A tailor-made holiday to Iceland.,"I wanted a company who could organise a holiday to Iceland for my wife and myself. It had to be individually tailor-made for two independent travellers, with the company doing all the necessary bookings, including all excursions whilst in Iceland. Pete listened very carefully to me detailing our requirements, discussing them at length to make sure he had an exact clear picture of what we wanted. Within 24 hours he had come up with a fully-costed package including a very attractive 4 star hotel, flights and a programme of activities and excursions which met all our needs, and more besides.

Our travel consultant (Amelia) made great recommendations, understood our needs, provided a bunch of different options and the price was much better than I could have achieved through an independent booking.  Will very happily use this company again.  In fact, we plan to use them again in the not too distant future to booking our holiday for next summer.",UK,5,2,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.225, 'compound': 0.9753}",0.9753

Emma explained that there might be a lag in response, as she had to contact the resort to ensure availability. We were impressed by her approach, honesty, and integrity. Happily, the villa we wanted was available, so we booked straight away.Throughout the process, Emma kept in touch, even on her days off.The whole experience was incredibly smooth and reassuring. Emma answered all our questions promptly.We are ex-pats and have lived and travelled all over the world, but Emma has ignited our trust in the whole package holiday concept again.

Emma O‚ÄôReilly and Jo - Dream team,"Emma O‚ÄôReilly was soooo thorough, it made my wife and I feel so at ease. She made us feel that she cared about our holiday even more than we did! She listened intently to our very detailed criteria then proceeded to serve us up an awesome deal with a room upgrade we weren't expecting, a better food option and ¬£500 cheaper than our budget! When we then took a U turn and decided to up our budget and quoted another stay we'd found with another travel agent, she then swiftly not only offered a price lower then the other agent, but added an extra nights stay! Totally blowing the other quote out of the water, and doing it in hours not days. She outclassed the other travel agents we had asked to look and very quickly it became clear that Emma was 'the chosen one' in all aspects. Better holiday choices at better prices, more efficient, more thorough and nothing was too much trouble. We felt very looked after and she exceeded our expectations as to what a travel advisor would provide. In the future we'll stop shopping around for hours and just pick up the phone to Emma instead! On the day of booking she was off and said a colleague of hers would be there if we needed to book it. No sooner had my wife and I decided to go ahead we got a courtesy call from Joanna Kaye saying she was the appointed person taking our account in Emma's brief one day absence and if we should need anything at all she was there. That proactive approach was very impressive. Jo was friendly, helpful, professional and had a great sense of humour, you could sense destinology is filled with 'A players' and fair play to the management for their staff selection and onboarding process, it clearly works and the staff are very proud working for the company.

Issue resolved,"I have used Destinology for years and have always had a good experience. Sadly, in this instance I feel the pressure to make a sale took over and the resort we ended up in is well below the standard we are used to. As I was in a rush to book something at the last minute I relied on Destinology, asking them to look at the 8+ holidays booked with them, to recommend a resort in Greece. I am now in such recommended hotel and to be honest, I‚Äôd rather be home.I agree with the response from Destinology.  After I called to voice my disappointment, Lauren was extremely helpful and responsive and she arranged to promptly move us to a different resort.   The first resort recommended was recommended within an hour or so of my call and even though it was late in the day Lauren was very apologetic that she may not be able to move us that night. I didn‚Äôt  expect that  anyway but it was very reassuring that our experience was taken seriously. I had the chance to think about the recommended resort overnight but I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure about it. When I spoke to Lauren the next morning she had already been working on a second back up option which is what we ended up with and promptly moved that day. The second resort was outstanding and  we ended up having a fabulous family holiday. I also really appreciated that Lauren gave us the heads up that she was handing over our file to a colleague while she was away for an afternoon and after our move, checked in with us to make sure all was well. Lastly, I also believe Destinology upgraded our airport transfer on our way back to a very luxurious private van which was a lovely gesture. Overall, a very personal, thoughtful and knowledgeable handling of a difficult situation so a five star rating for that.

On their website Destinology claim that they ""offer a dedicated concierge experience to match the luxury quality of our holidays"" and that ""from the moment you call, to your return home, your dedicated concierge is on hand to assist you with anything you need"".In reality, we've spent over a week sending repeated emails to their customer service team to see whether they can provide us with accommodation for the night or any kind of compensation, and every single one has been ignored. God help us if we actually encounter an issue on holiday that requires immediate assistance.So I really can't see the point of this company at all. You'd be better off booking direct as going through them doesn't seem to add any value and if anything makes getting any issue resolved even more frustrating.Very disappointed.Edit: Despite the reply from the company below, after 2 weeks waiting for a response they weren't any help at all, apart from suggesting we stay at our own expense in the airport hotel overnight.

Perfect holiday in the Maldives,"Wow , I‚Äôve just had the most amazing holiday in the Maldives .

The first Niyama which was impeccable  , just like paradise in the pictures . All the staff couldn‚Äôt do enough to help and make our stay unforgettable. The food was beautiful in all the speciality restaurants on the island, I won‚Äôt ever forget the underwater restaurant we visited, we were able to sea so much sea life  . We got  around the island on personalised bikes which were waiting outside our beach pool villa . Just perfect . Our second island Varu was also wonderful with a different feeling about it . The all inclusive package was a real treat , again the food was wonderful, and the staff were so attentive . We stayed in a water bungalow this time rather than a beach villa and the contrast was a nice change , giving us a taste of two different aspects of the Maldives . This island offers fabulous water sports activities , some of which are included in your stay . We had lots of fun here . Cocktails with a complete relaxed atmosphere. Another thing which was sorted without a hitch where the transfers , the seaplane along with the speedboat ran completely smoothly there and back with so many of the hotel staff there to help us .

Not happy... ALL THEY WANT IS YOUR MONEY,"i booked my 10 year anniversary holiday to the maldives, I explained to the agent my requirements over the phone and he gave me options i explained i was unable to take one of the resorts as it did not have a water villa pool and that was one of my MAIN requirements, i mean how can you go to the maldives and get a water villa without the pool it just does not make any sense. when we arrived we were not informed about the extra transfer which took us another 4 hours added to our travel time and when we arrived to our resort we were super excited and when we entered our room we found out we did not have a pool in our villa this was my gift to my husband for our 10 year anniversary. extreamly annoyed and shattered i burst out in tears and was assured by the resort manager they could see what they could do i emailed Bruce who was my travel agent and he did not respond i emailed the destinology help desk and they said they will look into the matter but that took 2 days to do so and they said there was no mention of a water pool villa i informed them i have never been to the maldives and assumed all water villas come with a pool as the picture which was showed to me had a pool. every day i emailed them and we were only there for 4 nights in the end we managed to get an upgrade for 1 night which we had to pay extra for. when we returned i was called by the destinology team for reviews i explained my whole situation to her and from what i felt she left the conversation she will take this further and she told me she will get someone to call me its now been 4 months i emailed destinology and they still have not replied back to me and no further calls were made to me. we wanted this to be a very special trip but i would definately recommend that you do your own research for the resort you have chosen and they do hide some details from you to make the sale.i read all the other reviews and i agree after paying in full for my holiday I had to call them up as i had not received any of my hotel accomodation or flight tickets they informed me every time i called that Bruce is not well and he will contact me a day before i was leaving after getting angry is when i received my tickets and hotel vouchers. i booked Destinology for my honeymoon and we were so happy and we agreed that we will book with them again for our 10 year anniversary. but i think they are declining in customer service i had to fork our an additional ¬£350.00 for an upgrade and lost a day oin travelling as we had to wait at male airport for 4 hours before taki9ng another 1 hour domestic flight which we only found out when we arrived at male airport so we lost a day absolutely horrible service.",UK,1,0,"{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.882, 'pos': 0.062, 'compound': 0.4894}",0.4894

Awful service,"Are you wanting to book a luxury trip of a lifetime? Or perhaps even a honeymoon? Or just a getaway with a nice element of luxury? Confused about what to do and where to stay? Have no worries destinology will ensure you go absolutely nowhere. I‚Äôve had two different agents try to arrange my trip to South Africa, 1 who to be quite fair did respond but failed to take on board anything  that I said. Often placing hotels and routes not on my plans and sending a trip several times over the budget specified. Secondly, then stopped replying to emails perhaps maybe cause she couldn‚Äôt accept that someone would want something different to what was planned? I begrudgingly accepted defeat and I thought I‚Äôd try again this time by phoning my enquiry through. Surely the phone service will be better? Again a pleasant woman answered and took down some details and told me to expect a response back by the latest after 48 hours. She gave me an extension to reach her personally and I anxiously awaited a response. 48 hours passed and nothing... so I waited another 48 hours. I called several times a day and no answer. It‚Äôs a good job I used someone who actually cared otherwise I‚Äôd probably be sat at home right now rather than going on holiday. Despite using destinology in the past and having zero issues I‚Äôm actually disappointed with how downhill the company has gotten.

Never use again‚Ä¶..,"Amy was great at making our booking and taking our money but that was where the good customer service ENDED. There were red flags such as getting our names and DOB wrong on the booking which we asked her to correct. A few weeks before our holiday we asked for advice on Covid testing she kept sending us web links through to complicated govt websites - we just wanted her to tell us what was needed. This was not possible.We then went to look at our ETIHAD flight bookings and noticed she had spelt our sons name wrong on the flight details. This had to be changed.When we arrived at our hotel we were booked for 6 days not 7. We then had to query this to get it sorted. Even though we escalated our concerns to destinology they just didn‚Äôt seem bothered in actually helping us - beyond a fruit bowl and house wine being put in our room by way of an apology. It appears to me that they do no checks on the booking which ultimately caused stress for us. Their website says  ‚ÄòWith Destinology you receive your own personal travel consultant, who will ensure that no detail is overlooked - however small - right from your initial enquiry, all the way through to you returning home.‚Äô This was clearly not the case and we would have been better making the booking directly ourselves.We will never use destinology again",UK,1,0,"{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.83, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': 0.4854}",0.4854

Destinology..... Let's see how they fix this mess,"After specifically asking for a beach resort in Malta and spending close to ¬£3000 for the trip itinerary looked like it met the requirements I also requested a sea view the hotel ended up being in the middle of town I have a brick wall for a view no rooms are sea view and the beach is out the hotel down the street and then onto an joining part allocated for the hotel I also asked for an adult hotel this to was out of key putting me in a family hotel in the middle of downtown not the best area either.I  also asked for a room close to the lift I have a 200 meter walk which only aggravates things further since I suffer pain a lot .It's my second day of a 7 day trip I complained on getting to the hotel I have not even had a reply as to anything they would do for me.This is not the trip I wanted or asked for and for the money could have gone almost anywhere for a 7/day trip being my first in two years and also being a past client of destinology I would say start to look at other luxury agents as this is far away from the service I used to get.If I booked the flight myself and hotel it would have cost me only 1400 instead of 2750I question the value of destinology and the service and quality provided At least for the moment.The staff and food here are ok but what I paid for was not this By far.I am now trying just to get a better room but would never have booked this trip to begin with and destinology should at least have the courtesy to try sort out something anything as promised.The new room I sorted out was no better.Don't trust the itinerary look up the hotels on offer yourself.I trusted the premium rate we all pay destinology to take the headache out of things and have a professional arrange my trip which is what we pay for.I won't do it again at the moment let's see what Destinology does for me after this awfully booking have given them the opportunity to fix this lets see what happens will update...I have now had contact with Destinology and have a 28 day wait for review I except  a refund or credit to spend and go on the trip I should have and only stayed for 3 nights in total I returned to uk buying another ticket myself  as the hotel was that bad,,,,I did have call back only for me being told there was not a better option available so booked a new flight and returned to uk.    ""Do Not book Intercontinental Malta"".....under any circumstances understaffed rooms have sticky floors , lifts broken, no room service , restaurants advertised as 6 one was closed the rest opened sporadicly no dedicated room service even till 11pm as was said to me making it a 4 star by default, staff themselves at the hotel agreed with everything I said to them and the hotel is also facing a construction site with constant noise , the sky bar was shut out whole time , room fridge was empty it might as well been a serviced apartment by no way a 5 star Hotel.They cut corners everywhere I did not even have my room turned down once in my stay the hotel is due a refurbishment am told...Staff were polite and tried to help but they are overworked as the shortage of staff was really bad they all were running from one job to another.Bottom line am waiting to see shat happens with Destinology , will they fix this mess or not..Will let you know how they sort out this kind of mess...Is just as important and am giving them the opportunity to fix this mistake of a trip I was sent on."" Don't Book intercontinental ""New update November 5th,,,,Destinology has now refunded me what I spent as a credit to use to book another trip, it should be noted that while I had an awful trip Destinology has testified it in the best possible way and is as important how companies fix the bad experiences you may have with them it has given me the confidence to book with them again and am happy so far by the results if my complaint .",UK,4,2,"{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': 0.5345}",0.5345

It was so family oriented, families  from all over the world, an amazing place to stay. We got lucky and were able to check in at 11am shortly upon arrival. Per Kirsty‚Äôs advice we have selected half-board, which worked really well, there was so much food, we couldn‚Äôt actually finish our meals as they want you to pick from each option for dinner and it ended up being a lot, drinks were included as well, which seems only Destinology had that Platinum deal going.We used Destinology‚Äôs local partner Alpha tours, which seems to be a prominent operator in Dubai. Agent was very helpful, didn‚Äôt push us to purchase any deals, but we did get booked for Desert Safari ad Burj Khalifa which came with free tickets for Aquarium and Underwater zoo. That alone with variety of experiences available to be booked at Atlantis itself, we were busy until our departure. Safari was amazing and surprisingly there was quite a big dinner which all of us didn‚Äôt expect based on the price of the ticket, plus entertainment. It was an absolute joy.  We met another family from UK, who stayed at Jumeirah at the Palm and they were planning a day trip to Atlantis. They were also very happy with Destinology and had a few experiences booked in addition to safari.All in all a 5 star experience with Destinology, I am now considering future family trips to be sourced with them.",UK,5,2,"{'neg': 0.01, 'neu': 0.828, 'pos': 0.162, 'compound': 0.9953}",0.9953

Dissapointment,"We tried to book our honeymoon through Destinology. Whilst at first they appeared friendly.

Anthony and Paul were inconsistent in sending over the correct quotes as required. On a few occasions the quotes were sent for the wrong hotel. In addition they can't just email you. You have to follow a link. The company seems to be a sausage factory with little thought for the customer. The staff are slap dash and have little pride. Once we managed to find what we wanted and struck a deal with Anthony for a price that was agreeable. Upon booking we were advised this was incorrect. Email evidence was provided. We were given a 'best price'. However a quick search online and we found plenty of other providers cheaper. We booked through Virgin in the end. We gave Destinology every chance to offer a competitive price. Little interest. If your looking to spend 6k+ on a holiday. There are plenty of other providers that will treat you better.

They refused stating that ATOL regulations did not allow this but said would liase with our ins. companies.  Our insurance companies refused to speak to a third party.It took them two months to issue a statement from their legal department saying due to the terms and conditions of ATOL licensing, we are unable to provide a breakdown of costs.  It then took a further month to confirm they would not give us a breakdown and only because we gave them a deadline.We asked ATOL if this was the case and they said it was rubbish.

Better off booking direct yourself,"Really don't know why anyone pays over the odds with this lazy company. From the outside they look great, great website, good high street stores with suitably impressive store fit outs. But don't let that fool you into thinking they go above and beyond because they do the bare minimum to make your booking feel special. Went into the Wilmslow store, explained that I was looking to make a honey moon booking that it needed to be extra special. They emailed over some good choices, the email looks great, really slick and professional. Turns out tho they are charging ¬£800-¬£1000 more than if you book direct through the operator itself (we checked after unfortunately!!)They booked us flights, but then it turned out, we need to log into and pay extra if we wanted to reserve seats together (being a honeymoon this year was a pretty essential requirement) Anyway long story short, arrived at our 5star hotel and they had no record that it was our honeymoon. When I emailed our agent I was told it was a computer glitch that was the fault. So what does ¬£800 more get you........excuses and sod all difference than if you booked it direct yourself. Although we did get a nice leather folder that our boarding passes went into, maybe that's where the money goes, because it is not customer service. Would never ever ever use destinology again.

Booked honeymoon,"I booked a honeymoon with Destinology a few months ago as they beat a quote i had initially got and no one seemed to be able to beat their price. Having looked at the awards they won and the reviews, I felt secure booking with them.Initially they were great and responded quickly and politely to everything before i booked. I had booked the holiday months in advance so after I was booked, there was no contact for a while. This is where I had an issue. I wasn't hearing anything back so closer to the time I got in touch with destinology asking about my documents and seats etc. The person I was dealing with told me that she had tried to call me a couple of months earlier to ask about our seating requirements but that she couldnt get through. She said she had left a voice message, which is untrue as I didnt have one. What annoyed me is that she didnt try to call again and the fact that she could have e-mailed me. Because I had apparently missed the opportunity to discuss this, I had missed out on a chance to select any good seats left and was left to choose whatever was available. But selecting from those seats were pointless too, as we never got what we wanted on any of the flights. I got past that, and had other queries and noticed other errors on the itinerary. I had kept e-mailing the consultant i was dealing with, but never seemed to get a response. I was often told i'd get a call, but never did. The only time I got any answers was when I had to call up myself. Would have been nice to get replies to the e-mails I had sent. At one point i got fed up and wrote an e-mail of complaint which also seemed a waste as the response I got ignored all I had to say and just asked what my queries were. Also one of my flights had changed to a day later but the only reason I knew about this was because I called her for something else, otherwise I probably wouldnt have even been notified and new itinerary sent! Whilst I feel that the customer service before flying was very poor, I do appreciate the consultant sorting the whole thing out for us. Everything was ok, there was a problem with one of the transfers not turning up to pick us up from the hotel but that was the fault of the pick up company and not destinology. I was reimbursed for it with no problems.  Overall a good experience as everything went ok with the holiday, it was just the customer service beforehand that I was disappointed with.

Out-of-this-world drinking experience and fantastic customer service!,"Whenever I was hanging out with friends and they were having a drink or two, I would always just drink boring, non-alcoholic drinks because I don't like alcohol. I never had a good alternative to alcoholic drinks. This is why I was instantaneously excited when, by chance, I came across Feragaia. Straightaway, I went to their website wanting to order a bottle but then was bitterly disappointed that the only option was UK shipping. Still totally thrilled by my discovery, I gave it a try and contacted the Feragaia team directly. The founders responded immediately and without further ado made fast and reliable shipping to Germany possible. Just ten days after discovering Feragaia, I held a bottle of it in my hands and had a first try. Feragaia not only met my expectations but exceeded them. With only a drop of Feragaia, every plain soft drink becomes a drink worth remembering. Since then, I have tried many non-alcoholic cocktails with Feragaia and loved every one of them. By now, my first bottle is almost empty and I'm very sure it won't be my last one. Thank you Bill and Jamie for this great invention! I'm a huge fan!

Back to the drawing board,"I've tried a few non-alcoholic spirits recently, and while this is definitely not as undrinkable as some... It is still really minging.  I tried it in several ways, and with mixers... Still minging.   It is is difficult to describe, but the smell and taste reminds me of some kind of poultice or topical herbal medicine (not in a good way like underberg or jagermeister though).  I really wanted to like it, but the search for an enjoyable booze free spirit must continue.    The service/delivery was fine, but I felt the need to post this review when I realised Feragaia are removing and blocking any non-positive comments under their facebook adverts... Which ain't very honest.Reply to the Reply:  Thanks for getting in touch Jamie.  There is no need for a refund, I bought your product - and you supplied it - so all is good there.  I just really didn't like it. (Btw, having no sugar or sweetener was agreat selling point for me - and I'm pretty sure a sweeter version would not have appealed to more).   The one star I gave is fair mirror of my experience though.    And by the way - someone blocked me from being able to post a comment under your adverts - and all I said was that I found the taste minging - even with mixers - nothing more negative than that.  On the day I did that several other people had said the same thing, the next day I was blocked from commenting and both my and other peoples 'negative' comments were definitely all gone - with the same positive comments I'd seen the day before still there.... - So someone is cleaning up the comments on your facebook posts.",UK,1,0,"{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.768, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': 0.98}",0.98

Versatile and refreshing alcohol-free option,I read about Feragaia in an Economist article about alcohol-free drink options and decided to try it.

Everything first class but the flavour wasn't originally for me......,"Everything, customer service, packaging, marketing etc was first class EXCEPT for the actual flavour of the product...which was, for me at least, horrible to BEGIN with.I had high expectations based on all I read and am looking for something to drink during the week instead of whisky. I realise it will not taste like whisky but hoped for the warming complexity and viscous mouthfeel of a decent speyside or lowland whisky. I originally described this as tasting like the back of a really old dusty cupboard and is too thin. I tried adding ginger ale and tonic which improved it but not enough to make me want to drink it.That said I seem to be in the minority as most people writing reviews seem to love it.I was pleasantly surprised that the boss at Feragaia got in touch with me and asked how he could make things better. We chatted by email and he made some suggestions for mixers which, to be fair, considerably improved things as far as taste was concerned.He suggested some citrus based cocktails and additions and some ways of sweetening the product to my taste and I ended up quite enjoying the suggestions.I will stick with it because it's growing on me and because the company was so helpful I feel like they deserve a chance in difficult times.I do think it's really expensive for what it is since it has no alcohol duty to pay. BUT again it was explained that currently they are selling small quantities so in reality expensive ingredients coupled with all the costs of getting started will inevitably make it seem dear.

A taste worth aquiring,"UPDATED REVIEW: I do applaud the care and work that has gone into this but when I first tasted Feragaia (without any mixers as I wanted to know it's pure taste), I found it was not really to my palate. And personally, I do feel that while there is to me, a welcome slightly smokey element, I find that the botanicals also give a bit of a medicinal tang.That said, Feragaia do offer a number of mixer and mocktail suggestions and I was a little hasty in my judgement. I have now tried it with slices of clementine, some of the juice squeezed in, and topped up with tonic and lots of ice in a long glass. My tastebuds were very happy - I was pleasantly surprised to find that it felt like I was having a ""real"" drink at the end of the day. The benefit was I had two of them while cooking dinner on a week night without feeling a little fuzzy - nice. On a weekend, with a bit more time, I might yet venture into some mocktail making. I may even try mix it with some alcohol on occasion (sorry Jamie!). But for an alcohol-free day option, I'll be hitting the Feragaia & clementine tonic option again.",UK,4,2,"{'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.85, 'pos': 0.138, 'compound': 0.984}",0.984

Read this,"I'm an ex alcoholic. I'm not looking for an alcohol replacement or a ""mimic."" I see so many reviews from people on numerous non-alcoholic spirits basically disappointed because they've not managed to emulate a spirit, minus the alcohol content. Honestly, those people are fools. A non-alcoholic spirit should be exactly what Feregaia have created.... a premuim and thoughtful alternative for those that wish to own a drink that they can enjoy socially, or alone, and appreciate it's thoughtful crafting. The price point also makes me feel like i'm buying a premuim drink, not an overpriced gimic, which some are. I think it adds value to the produce but keeps it affordable or ""worth it""I sat down to enjoy my first drink last night and poured myself a nice brandy sized portion, on the rocks, and i honestly LOVE it. It's what i've been looking for. It has a rich and noticabole flavour and the warmth isn't an attempt at reproducing alcohol, although it's not a million miles away, it's just an epic finisher to let you know you're drinking something with character. It will be most definitely my ""spirit of choice"" It's the only one that's clearly distilled but still manages to retain amazing flavour where most are watery and bland. Honestly, sometimes they are like sweetened water although i can appreciate the process and the thought. Others are very different again and are their own, often fruity or peppery botanical concoctions and some are really lovely. However, the feeling of enjoying a balanced and thoughtful spirit, with none of the alcohol but all of it's own charm and flavour, is something i've not yet been able to find and is the thing that made me enjoy spirits in the past.

Bringing back wanderlust,"Feragaia, for me, is the opportunity to do things differently without compromising on the cherished aspects of tradition: achieved by the perfect blend of 14 botanicals ‚Äì so we're told.

While alcohol-free drinks have always been too sweet for my taste or end up being disappointingly bland, Feragaia is not just an alternative you settle for but an after-work (or after breakfast, that's the fun of it...) pleasure in its own right.

"Finally, a dry non-alcohol drink with an adult flavour","I've been looking for a drink like this for a long time. I've tried a few recent non-alcohol spirits, such as Seedlip and I find them either plain horrible, or too sweet. They are also usually pointless - you may as well just drink the mixer on its own. But Feragaia is way better. It is an acquired taste - my first sniff and taste were not very favourable. I tried it with tonic - yes a bit better, then with ginger ale as recommended, but this is too sweet for me. So I persevered as a purist, topping it up with a little sparkling water and a slice of orange or lemon. So no added sweetness or calories or chemicals... After maybe 3 or 4, over a few days, I found myself really enjoying the (very adult) flavour. I usually drink San Pellegrino if I can, when avoiding alcohol, but Feragaia has given me a reason to sometimes choose a change of flavour. And I should add that the service is excellent, with speedy delivery - I congratulate Jamie, the founder, on persevering with what cannot have been an easy development.

It's a sophisticated drink that is refreshing and not too sweet, and is a great alternative for those that are not drinking alcohol for whatever reasons. You can sip and enjoy Feragaia like you would a fine whiskey, or mix it with tonic or soda to create a delicious and energising spritzer.For those evenings that you are trying to rev up your normal cocktail, Feragaia can add a new twist (with an orange slice, of course) to your classic G&T.

A big lie,"This agency is not serious at all, it is a real BIG LIE, they let me down in a critical situation, me, my wife and my baby. Stolen my money.  I booked a Holidays with them to Salou, they were very quick to take the payment certainly. No problem, I was so happy with their speech thinking I found a serious agency that I could trust. Arriving to Salou, everything was ok. I said: Ah, finally the negative comments I have read about them were wrong The last day to come back to England, surprise.  After two hours waiting for the coach to go to the Airport, a named DAN from the Agency called me, informed me that unfortunately Raynair was on Strike, asking me to book MYSELF a return flight for two days later. Reassuring me that they will REFUND ME the hotel room for two more nights. I found this strange that DAN asked me to do it myself as it s the Agency responsibility to do it. I insisted with him on the phone, but again, he didn‚Äôt stop reassuring me, repeating that they will refund me every penny I paid. It was horrible to find an available hotel room, was disappointed, stressed but I need a room ASAP for my baby. I spent all the time searching for a return flight. When I came back to England, the nightmare started. I spent two months talking with different persons from the Agency, I emailed them all the proofs, the hotel room invoice, the flight tickets but they were repeating the same sentence: We are treating your case. Finally, the most courageous of their member team told me that they were not going to refund me the hotel stay just the flight when Raynair decides to refund them. I told her that DAN and JORDAN promised me to refund everything. She simply responded:  You have no written proof about it. Which means DAN was just lying and my money stolen. I am so disappointed and disgusted about their behavior, disrespect and lies.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!,"I went on a holiday with a company called Galaxy Holidays last June and we paid for transfers however they just did not turn up either way as in when we arrived and when we departed. We spoke to their rep at the resort and we‚Äôre brushed off by a rude member of staff. We have raised a complaint with them and they keep saying although we paid them everything as a package they are stating the problem lies with a third party contractor they work with for the transfers. Referring to the failures we were caused a great deal of inconvenience and distress as we spend all of our spending money on paying for the transfers that should have been provided. I was devastated with the situation and get helpless in a foreign country not knowing anybody and for my partner who suffers from anxiety and depression this was a welcome break that should have been a relaxing and fruitful experience. I‚Äôm any case we saw that Galaxy has an Abta membership and tried raising a complaint with Abta but galaxy is not coming up when you have to declare the name of the company in your complaint. We have tried calling in numerous occasions and keep being told that the current person a manager by the name of Kevin who is dealing with our complaint is very busy, cannot talk and will respond in due course as he is inundated. They seem to have a fair number of agents in the complaint section who all seem to be under the kosh so it is alarming and I wonder how many people are suffering as a result of their failures. From what I see on social media where I have contacted them also they will constantly upload new posts and the complaint messages are usually deleted. Thanks for reading guys and please avoid these guys like the plague they are incompetent and unapologetic and do not communicate.FURTHER NOTE AS OF 31/10/22 :So they have replied and said they will contact us ‚Äúaccordingly.‚Äù Still no contact from them it has been over 6 months clearly they do not care about resolving genuine customer complaints.",UK,1,0,"{'neg': 0.154, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': -0.9831}",-0.9831
We booked a dream holiday which turned‚Ä¶,"We booked a dream holiday which turned into a nightmare. 3 days before we were to leave. We were told the flights they had 'booked' for us were cancelled by Turkish Airlines with our 30kg baggage allowance for our 2week holiday. Initially told us we could go from Manchester and we would have to pay an extra ¬£400 for the privilege and get it our own way to the airport 200 miles away from our original booking. Ended up being emotionally blackmailed into accepting very poor flights as our holiday was imminent. Also told that the other elements of our holiday were non refundable and we should claim on our travel insurance if we couldn't accept the flights.This resulted in having to go via Prague on the way to Egypt and on the return having to get our own way between Milan airports for an extra out of pocket ¬£140 as they booked it as a self transfer even though the flights was coming in late at night and there were little options to get there on time for a flight when the last train left before we could get to Milan Central and we had to fork out for a taxi or potentially miss the flight home as Milan airports are 90 km aoart. The other major problem is that we were sold the holiday on the basis of the itinerary on the cruise ship. But they had not booked us on any of the trips, some trips were down as optional extras which we enquired about before we left and told the optional ones were extra. But not told that the trips in the supposed itinerary were not included either. Ziya deserves a special mention for his awfulness in making what should have been a well earned holiday very stressful. We feel we have been scammed out of our money as the Airline had a responsibility to book us on alternative flights as to not disrupt our trip but Galaxy did not help us get decent flights. These original flights were either never booked out Galaxy don't know their clients consumer. We have no reason to ever use Galaxy again. And are concerned that they can advertise in The Metro as though they are a legitimate company. Use anyone else. They don't deserve the one star but that is the lowest I can go",UK,1,0,"{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.874, 'pos': 0.067, 'compound': 0.4192}",0.4192

Never again with Galaxy Holiday,"Firstly, If I could give a No Star rating, I would of done exactly that.Secondly, I wished I'd read the reviews before I picked up the phone to book a holiday from Hell with Galaxy Holidays. Thirdly, This Company are a Scam artists. Why are  they still allowed to operate as a company,  I'll never understand. I should of known when I was speaking with what sounded like an Asian man with a name of Kevin Jeffries. I have had to make other calls to them for one reason or another, the same thing. Asians but with English names. I should of smelled the üêÄ there and then.Right!!! Where to start but the beginning. I saw Galaxy Holidays advertised in the Metro paper. I thought with everything we'd been through with the Pandemic and all, I thought I deserved an holiday.The Agent that answered my call was Kevjn Jeffries.  Of course he was friendly and chirpy, that was so he could rob me blind.I explained to him that we were Two pensioners don't worry he said, I'll look after you. Yeah Right!!! Look after yourself more like. There were a few holidays he mentioned which sounded nice and would not break the piggy bank. This was the bait.We managed to find and agree on a holiday we could begin to work on. Now this is the 1st catch, after deciding  and we were now to pay, all of a sudden, there was an admin charge of ¬£36 per person. We swallowed that. As pensioners, he guaranteed us nothing above the 4th floor, he made out he had put in a speciaal request for us. My Foot!!! we ended up on the 11th floor.Also knowing that we were a couple of pensioners, he did not mention that the apartment was situated at the top of a Steep Hill.Whilst trying to sell us this holiday he  mentioned that there was WiFi and all the mod cons that usually comes with an holiday. That was not the case.He knew he was booking us a holiday with a late flight, that was not the problem, what he and the rest of the team did not tell us, was that we needed to travel from our apartment to an unknown destination at 1am to go and pick up the keys as no one will be there to welcome us. It was either a 30 minute walk or a taxi ride of ‚Ç¨10 there and another ‚Ç¨10 back to the apartment we had settled for. Bearing in mind, we had our luggage with us.They also forgot to mention that we had to pay a deposit of ‚Ç¨150 before they could hand over the keys.On getting back and had gained access to the apartment,  we found out there was no remote control to operate the TV. fine, there was nothing we could do but to wait for the office to open later that morning.10am, we were down at the office, this was were the nightmare began to unravel.They were asking for us to pay ‚Ç¨45 to access the Internet for 2 weeks and another ‚Ç¨25 for the remote control for the television.Non Refundable We could not argue with them as the Guy, did not care and was not interested. He kept pointing to his stupid sign on the wall with a notice on it that said, that a fee is needed for WiFi and TV and basically wanted us to go and leave him alone as we were wasting his time. A Very Rude Man he was. We decide to pay for the WiFi but said no to the stupid remote control. It took 2 more days to finally get Internet after we had paid him the ‚Ç¨45. The apartment was not that great, they had not cleaned the apartment. It was filthy and had the smell of sweat, urine and alcolhol from the previous tenants I'm guessing. All the blankets was filthy and smelt. After complaining, ( I must admit they came with a load of clean and fresh bankets)The sofa which can be use as a sofa bed in the living room also smelled of sweat, urine and alcohol.As we do, we cleaned the apartment out for our own sake this was after we had to go to the supermarket to get the toiletries needed along with plenty of air freshners. Just so we could make the most of the rest of our holiday, making me a cleaner for a company that mislead us.But yet; Galaxy Holidays were quick to hound us by telephoning me the following day after we had booked the holiday for the balance even after I had a deadline date which was still a week away. Yet everytime I called them up for one thing or another, it was always "" Someone will call you back, which they Never"". In all the years I have been traveling,  I have never come across a bunch of thieves and liars calling themselves a ""Travel Agent"".This will not put me off traveling  but as taught me a Valuable Lesson. And what they said was that on the day we leave, it is down to us to take the keys back to the agents knowing we have an early transfer at 10:35am, yet the agent opens at 10am now leaving one person with the luggage outside the apartment whilst the other had to run down that hill, 10 mins walk round to the seafront to give back the keys and get back our deposit of ‚Ç¨150 then have to rush back up that hill to catch the Transfer that is, if I haven't had an heart attack by then.

We even had an intruder in our room and felt very intimidated by all this. We requested help from Delta on several occasions after complaining to the hotel and getting no help. Despite Delta saying they would relocate us and call us back, they never did. In the end we had no choice but to abandon our holiday and still Delta are unwilling to help.

After I dropped my review yesterday, one of their agents by the name Ziya Dakni contacted me and dealt absolutely well with my situation.  We ended up having  a good laugh. The whole point of leaving a review is to help others to navigate their search properly when searching and also to  let the company know how they are doing in terms of customer service . If there is need for improvement then they should change. I am happy to say that Ziya took care of the situation  and I hope they are able to improve on their customer service. Hopefully they won't be letting me down again. Thanks Ziya. I will therefore increase the star to 4 stars.",UK,4,2,"{'neg': 0.044, 'neu': 0.781, 'pos': 0.175, 'compound': 0.9928}",0.9928

Lovely venue but all closed up Monday - Wednesday so room only,"We booked through mr & mrs smith as a treat since our honeymoon flight was cancelled. We expected a lovely hotel, location and general ambiance. The room was lovely but the restaurant was completely shut and we were the only guests. The whole vibe was poor and unlocking doors to enter an empty building is definitely not what we imagined. To make it worse the only reason we knew the restaurant was shut was as we emailed requesting a table for dinner and they replied saying they were shut and we would need to pick up keys from the restaurant up the road. If we had not emailed there is no way we would have this information. The final straw is the fact we booked a b&b experience‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ because the restaurant was shut Monday-Wednesday we again told to go to the restaurant up the road. However they did not open till 9 so the advert saying ‚Äòearly birds could get fruit, yogurt, pastries etc‚Äô was not true.

The hotel treated us well, but -especially given their high prices- also needs to drastically invest in a better ‚Äòbalancing act‚Äô:Location is extremely awesome. Not many hotels in the world beat this view, surroundings, secludedness. Staff is super nice, warm, accommodating (host Irene is a blast)! Wellness quality/massage team is great! (Bath)Rooms & balconies are spacious, beds really comfortable! Lots to do, chilling in beautiful swimming pool area, or interesting (but expensive) activitiesüëçüèº BUT, furniture is rather old (fashioned). Tables, chairs, accessories, etc. is NOT up to date at all. It wobbles, is not comfortable, paint is chipped off, etc. Also design-wise, it does not blend in nicely with the light, serene surroundings (you‚Äôd expect natural, desert-like colours, etc). Simple things like logical lightning in the room, mosquito nets (so you can sleep with the delicious fresh air), etc. are all not in place. But a huge old fashioned TV screen and an old fashioned wooden desk is in the room? In such a grandeur hotel & location, we‚Äôd expect more eye for proper furniture, accessories & design. Also, staff is supernice but come across as a young, rather unexperienced team: they are clearly still learning/new, do not offer smooth 5-star experience. They are from all over the place and it felt no one could tell us a thing about Oman/local culture/food/the mountains/etc. Also, simple  questions about wine, food, etc. were answered (always very nice but) inappropriately. They just need (more/better) educationüí™üèºThe activities (& 4x4 transport) could be either more complementary or better priced. We booked high quality excursions via external guide, Alila asks >3 times the regular tour guide prices (we did quite some research here:)Shortly: huge potential, execution long way to go!

TOTAL scammers,"TOTAL scammers.  Do NOT TRUST them with your CREDIT CARD details.  They fraudulently ran mine through for E4,500!If you cancel a booking with a hotel booked through them (for health reasons in my case) you may lose the deposit - this is par for the course.  Mr & Mrs Smith will promise to help try to recover it though so don't worry.  BEWARE! Their 'help' consisted of:1.  Asking for my credit card details again but then, far from refunding the deposit (E4,500) to the card they took PAYMENT OF THE BALANCE (another E4,500).  Absolute fraudsters!  Fortunately my bank spotted their fraud and denied payment.  When asked to explain themselves - they simply avoided the question.2. They had said they'd help try to resell the suite.  I checked on their website and the suite had indeed been resold.  Yippee.  The only 3 bedroom suite this hotel had (Mougins Luxury Retreat) was showing 'unavailable' - and I reasonably deduced this was because they'd resold it. Later the 'Smith Team' explained this apparent rebooking was no such thing, but was actually 'a technical glitch' with their website.  That 'technical glitch' dissuaded me from offering this non-refundable booking (10 days in a 'luxury' hotel) to a friend/family member.  When asked for a refund, they refused.The next step for me is issuing a summons against them in the County Court.  If you'd like to follow my progress - or add your own experiences of them - I have purchased a URL with their name, and the word 'Scam'.  Please give me a week or so to populate it, then Google it.

Recent Stay,"We recently stayed for 8 nights at the Don Ferrante Hotel in Puglia, a lovely 5 star. We had a really nice time and the hotel was lovely. We stayed in the Carlos V suite which was fabulously located about 150 meters along the harbour. It was really well appointed with its own roof terrace and we would recommend. I would however say there were some little niggles that could have made things better. The breakfast was nice but the same every day with no variety. We only found out on the last day they did freshly squeezed orange juice if you asked - I would expect a 5 star to offer. It also took time to get tea and coffee which was frustrating. If this happened once it would not be worth mentioning but it was every day. They just needed to better organised with more staff. The hotel run a shuttle to a local beach which is lovely. There is a charge but it is only when you get there you realise there are different levels of cost with the hotel charging for the best rather than telling you the various options so you can make your own mind up. The most expensive option is just not worth it and you can pay 50 euros, half the price of the most expensive option. The final niggle was in the hotels roof terrace and pool area. If you wanted a drink or snack you had to go and find a member of staff. They never came round to ask. Whilst they would bring it to the lounger, they then never came  and cleared away. As I say, these are niggles but in a 5 star, expensive hotel, these can become irritating.

I was last week looking at the hotel and checked the room type Mr and Mrs Smith have booked for me. Which it states quite clearly on their website no children allowed in this room. So I call them and they told me the only room available for me and my child on the same dates is 700 euros per night!! 3 times more than my originalBooking. I have called mr and Mrs smith twice now to ask them what they are going to do about this as the error is theirs and they state we will get back to you very soon.

Mr & Mrs Smith messed up my honeymoon and made me pay for it.,"I booked my honeymoon through Mr & Mrs Smith in November 2021, six months prior to our wedding.  I had specifically been looking for a hotel in the Lake District with an outdoor hot tub that was dog friendly and close to amenities.  In February, Mr & Mrs Smith got in touch with me to explain that the room description on their site was incorrect, and my room did not have an outdoor hot tub.  They offered my three, useless, alternatives (i) change the dates (not an option as the purpose of the honeymoon is to have a break immediately after your wedding); (ii) change room to a bigger room with an indoor bathtub (a bath tub is not, in my view, an alternative for a hot tub.  I can have a bath at home); or (iii) cancel the booking, leaving me without any accommodation for my honeymoon.  I explained that none of these options presented a very satisfactory solution, and so was offered a fourth alternative - pay an extra ¬£200 a night for an alternative room at the same hotel with an outdoor hot tub.  Quite frankly, I am not sure why I should bear the cost of Mr & Mrs Smiths' or the Hotel's incompetence (I'm not entirely sure whose error the room description was), and so I asked to speak to the Manager of the customer complaints team.  I am still waiting to hear from them weeks later.  I think it is this that has irritated me the most about the whole experience, as the customer services team I spoke to were very pleasant and prompt, but their Manager is useless and refused to engage with a potentially difficult conversation - something you would have thought a customer services manager would be used to dealing with.  I have ended up paying the additional ¬£200 per night, as by the time I had waited for the Manager to come back to me, any equivalent accommodation locally was booked up.  My recommendation - find the hotels on the site and book direct, as Mr & Mrs Smith aren't adding any value.",UK,1,0,"{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.895, 'pos': 0.03, 'compound': -0.9148}",-0.9148

Price match issues,"Had a pretty rough time getting a price match for a hotel recently.

When I was actually able to reach someone on the phone the agents were really helpful, but email communication was poor and I had to follow up several times. The price match booking finally went through and was eventually fully confirmed, so am giving three stars, but even getting the correct voucher took additional time so it was definitely not a smooth and easy process.",UK,3,1,"{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.149, 'compound': 0.9044}",0.9044

Good value stay at the Cow in Dalbury Lees near Derby,We booked the Cow in Dalbury Lees through Mr & Mrs Smith. The accommodation was very good as the rooms have been recently upgraded. We were in No 1 which is a good size with a lovely double bed (quality bedding) and a walk in shower (rain and separate standard fitting). Quality Towels and dressing robes provided. The bar area is part of the original building and has a nice atmosphere. Car parking available on site.Due to staff shortages (same as many in hospitality) the restaurant was not available for meals other than breakfast. We were informed prior to arrival and the staff booked us for dinner at 2 local restaurants. A free taxi service was provided by the staff to the restaurant.The staff were very friendly and welcomed us warmly. Our mobile service provider did not have a good signal in the area but we were able to check emails and receive calls.The free bottle of wine was in our room on arrival as promised by Mr and Mrs Smith on the booking confirmation.Overall good value.,UK,4,2,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.159, 'compound': 0.9742}",0.9742

The most painful holiday booking experience of my life!,"This was honestly one of the most stressful experiences I've had in booking a holiday, let alone a holiday of a lifetime (our honeymoon). Where to start?! We usually book our own holidays directly with the hotel / airline, however on this occasion we were gifted quite a generous amount via Prezola and decided to use credit to purchase Mr & Mrs Smith vouchers. Luckily we knew exactly when and where we wanted to stay so it should have been straightforward. For a company that markets themselves as ""luxury"" I would have expected the highest of standards.I had already spoken to the hotel directly and forwarded the email to Mr & Mrs Smith to confirm how much a half board with transfers option would be. However, I was constantly told to wait until they had received an email back from the hotel. Why could they not simply put me on hold to clarify any small details? What should have taken minutes ended up taking almost 5 days to book because every individual I spoke to could not be bothered to pick up the phone to the hotel and insisted on emailing them for every detailStaff did not sound happy or say 'congratulations' when i mentioned it was our honeymoon and that we'd had to postpone our wedding 3-4 times and therefore the honeymoon too. They seemed robotic and incompetent with every small question I had for them.I had to explain how to convert USD to GBP to them (they wanted to email the hotel again to ask this!)Payment didn't go through because of their 'systems' so the booking was delayed yet again.At no point in my painful interaction with them was I offered any sort of apology or even acknowledgement in their handling of what is meant to be our once in a lifetime honeymoon to the Maldives. I find it shocking that people actually choose to use their services. If it wasn't for my persistence in getting the room booked i'd still be waiting for someone to email them back with a week left until our honeymoon! I'm also not quite sure what their 'value-add' is as I couldn't imagine they could have offered me any advice or benefits by using their terrible services!I've never been one to say this about a travel company before, but avoid at all costs and book your own holiday if you don't want to be stressed out beforehand!",UK,1,0,"{'neg': 0.069, 'neu': 0.878, 'pos': 0.053, 'compound': -0.5532}",-0.5532

A really challenging experience with Mr‚Ä¶,"A really challenging experience with Mr and Mrs Smith unfortunately. We were due to go on holiday in June 2020. They cancelled the holiday in May 2020 because of the pandemic which was expected, but would not refund. When rebooking a year later to use our credit with them, it was very difficult to get hold of them on the phone. Email responses were sporadic at best. We had no way of using our credit with them via their online booking system so had to persist with the telephones. The same holiday was going to cost us almost 50% more. When we eventually sorted out the rebooking (it took a month) we arrived at the hotel to find they had no details of our booking. They do no answer the phones during their advertised opening hours. They do not follow through with the the actions they promise in writing. I have so far submitted two complaints, neither of which have been responded to. My experience does seem contrary to the norm, and I‚Äôm sure COVID has put them under pressure, but their customer service has been appalling. Booking through Mr and Mrs Smith has brought with it a massive headache - what‚Äôs the point of going through an agent if they are not there to support when needed?

We did not have an enjoyable stay but the hotel have put things right,"UPDATED Please read to the end.*****************************We did not have an enjoyable stay. This was a rare outlay - an expensive and carefully considered hotel stay for me based on wanting somewhere relaxing for my wife and I stay. After checking out several high end boutique hotels in Cambridge, I made the decision to book a room at the University Arms based on how luxurious and decadent they claimed our stay would be and how pampered we would feel. When we first arrived we left our luggage with reception who said they would place it in our room and so we went off to explore Cambridge.When we returned and went up to the room, I was surprised to find that it was an accessible/disabled room. We went down to reception and asked if we could be moved because it didn‚Äôt feel like the bathroom would offer a particularly relaxing time for us given the low height (and small size) of the basin, the inconvenience of not having a vanity basin/unit and the fact that the removable shower head could only be set to a height of about 4 foot and therefore be used while sat down on the inbuilt disabled seat.However, we were told that the hotel was completely full and therefore we couldn‚Äôt be moved.Upon returning to the room, we discovered that our luggage hadn‚Äôt arrived so I called reception and they said they would bring it up immediately. After a short while, they called back and asked us to describe the luggage because they couldn‚Äôt identify it since it had not been labelled.After they found and brought up our luggage, we then discovered that our television didn‚Äôt work so we called down to reception again and they arranged for an engineer to visit the room who eventually worked out the issue so we could watch it. Then we started to get ready to go out for dinner and upon using the shower, discovered that there was only one bathrobe - we didn‚Äôt bother to report this since we d already contacted reception by this point on three occasions!When we went down for breakfast in the morning, we were told that breakfast wasn‚Äôt included. Despite the fact that I had specified early breakfast - 1x vegan and 1x vegetarian in the additional notes/requirements section when I first made the booking a couple of weeks prior to staying.Most of these things may be small issues and based on me being too sensitive or nit picking but it‚Äôs an expensive stay and I was hoping for better service.So, overall I felt like very little effort was made to make us welcome and relaxed and was left very disappointed in spending such a large amount on the room we were given. **********************Shortly after posting this same review to the hotel by email for their thoughts, I received an email advising me that somebody was looking into the issues for me and would come back to me.A few days after this, the same staff member contacted me with a very generous offer in the hope that it would restore faith in them to sometime stay again. The gesture and the effort that this stuff has gone to rectify my annoyance really impressed me and so I have added to the review and changed my star rating.",UK,5,2,"{'neg': 0.024, 'neu': 0.887, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.9895}",0.9895

Terrible customer service,"I had some gift cards to use so booked a stay through Mr and Mrs Smith. I maxed out the gift cards so had to top up with credit card. Soon after making the booking I noticed they had taken the payment twice and had made 2 bookings. They were closed at the time so I left a message on their chat function which promised a response within 24hrs. By the time I remembered that it had been 24hrs, I realised they hadn‚Äôt contacted me and now had the hotel asking me if I had meant to book twice (at least someone had picked up the problem!) and could I ask mr and Mrs Smith to cancel one of the bookings. I tried to call and finally after being in the queue for ages someone answered and when I explained the problem I was either hung up on or the line cut out. I waited a few mins to see if they‚Äôd call back but still nothing and by this point I was wondering how much it was going to take to get my money back. I called again, waited in the queue again and when I got through I said I wasn‚Äôt happy so far with having my money taken twice (I explained it must have been a system error because I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to use the gift cards twice) and not being contacted when I had been told I would and instead of ‚Äúlet me look into this for you‚Äù I got ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre the one who booked it twice‚Äù!!! I explained AGAIN that it was impossible for me to have booked it twice because the gift cards would have been empty. She then went to look into it and discovered it was in fact a system error and there was no apology for blaming me or acknowledging that she was out of order for not believing me when I said it was a system error. She instead said ‚Äúshall we just move on‚Äù well no actually, I‚Äôve never been spoken to so rudely by a customer service representative so I wasn‚Äôt ready to ‚Äújust move on‚Äù, I asked to speak to her manager who rectified the issue and apologised for the staff member but it has left a very sour taste and not what I‚Äôd expect from a company who claim to be so ‚Äúupmarket‚Äù.

I would whole heartedly tell anyone‚Ä¶,"I would whole heartedly tell anyone wanting to book a holiday with Mr & Mrs Smith to avoid them. The initial sales conversations were great but as soon as we had confirmed the booking we were totally disregarded. We were unlucky to have our honeymoon postponed due to Covid, but there was no correspondence from M&MS in relation to this. After much chasing I contacted the hotel directly and informed them we wouldn‚Äôt be staying that year. This was news to the hotel, but they were incredibly understanding and awaited our new dates. Eventually M&MS responded and confirmed our new dates. We asked what our options would be if we needed to cancel/postpone again, to which M&MS told us they were merely a booking agent and would not be issuing a refund under any circumstances. We crossed our fingers for travel this year (Sept 2021) and thankfully we did go. A week prior to travel we thought it best to contact M&MS to ensure all was fine with our booking (as we hadn‚Äôt heard from them in a year). After chasing I received confirmation 2 days prior to departure, what a relief! I was informed an email had been sent to an address that had been closed for 2 years and I had informed M&MS of this numerous times. We arrived at our hotel on the 6th Sept and on the 11th hotel I then received a booking confirmation from M&MS of our stay. All in all, a totally ineffective customer management and handling system. I realise the last 2 years in the travel industry have been awful but when you feel totally abandoned by a big brand such as this, it left us with a sour taste in our mouths over a holiday that is a once in a life time experience.Update: as of 27/09/21 - no contact from M&MS as per their comment below to ‚Äòreach out‚Äô.",UK,1,0,"{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.851, 'pos': 0.077, 'compound': 0.6222}",0.6222

A poor experience turned to an excellent one.,"We had a hotel booked in Sicily, the Mandranova, for September 2020.  When Covid hit, we were given no option other than to move the booking to the following year (all other bookings we had via other companies were refunded in full).  Fast forward to September 2021 and we cannot visit without significant risk.  And yet, the hotel chose to keep the ¬£600 we paid for this hotel.  I had trouble getting hold of Mr and Mrs Smith... I submitted a form to ask to cancel or for options to move the booking forward again.  No response for over a week.  We have been given no options.  We felt ripped off and frankly would have done better to book via another agency.  However, Mr and Mrs Smith have now come back to me and have fully refunded our hotel, at their own cost.  The issue was caused by a training issue and they were very apologetic about the confusion and frustration I experienced.

This tie up with Hilton Hotels in 2015 was however subsequently ditched I think when they rebranded and became Embarc.

Overall, the Week was great, the location (Sedona) was great. The Diamond presentation was HORRIBLE!!  I own a timeshare, and they ushered us into a room, only to tell us we do not understand how it works and that it's too expensive for us anyway. I just wanted it explained to me how 6500-10k points equates to 10weeks vacation a year.  How 48-65k mortgage and 2k-3k a year maintenance fees equates into the 60k savings over 20 years. The math doesn't add up. I asked legitimate questions so that I could understand the system and they in turn were irritated and insulting.They ushered us to another table where they try to sell you a sampler points package, and we were furious by then. I have sat through a number of these pitches in my lifetime and this was by far the most disappointing.  During the presentation they even spent time to show you the bad BBB reviews to explain away that it's only .0025% of their membership that are disappointed, but anyone with common sense knows that not everyone throws down disappointed ratings on BBB.

Worst business ever!,"There are very few words to describe Diamond Resorts and the vile people they have working for them. If there was a way to give them less than 1 star I would gladly do so. These miserable thieves have abused me long enough. I made the HUGE mistake of buying into a timeshare with Diamond and the entire experience has been a nightmare. When they sold me the timeshare, they were very kind and professional, they found every way possible to kiss up to me and convince me to buy a timeshare. At first, they didn‚Äôt call it a timeshare, they said it was a ‚Äúmembership‚Äù. The tricks didn‚Äôt stop there, these bums falsely claimed that what I was buying would double in price. I kept refusing to buy anything and explained that multiple times, but they would not take no for an answer. They kept lowering the price, but the truth is they were just covering up the other fees and actual costs. They falsely claimed that maintenance fees would stay a set price. They play a game with their point system, so you never really know what you‚Äôre getting until it‚Äôs too late. Don‚Äôt trust anything they say, it‚Äôs all fake. They just get you locked into their cycle of false promises and debt. I reached out to the office of Mark Wang the CEO directly and explained my experience. I received a call from one of their goons who very rudely called me a liar and threatened me. I was shocked that anyone would talk to me like that, let alone an employee from a pitiful company like Diamond Resorts.

Diamond Resorts is the absolute worst,"Diamond Resorts is the absolute worst! My experience with this company has been a never-ending headache from the start! It all began with their timeshare sales meeting, which is practically a hostage situation, where they told us a ton of lies and pressured us into getting sucked into their timeshare scheme. The staff was very aggressive, and they made their timeshares out to be ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù. They told us if we bought a timeshare, we‚Äôd make profit from renting it out. Despite all their promises this has yet to come to fruition. They told me I would have access to thousands of properties in their network but that too has proven to be a lie. I‚Äôve spent hours on the phone with them and NEVER have success in finding anything available. The timeshare is useless, you‚Äôre better off booking a hotel on a regular website instead of getting trapped into their timeshares. I should have known better when every time I refused an offer, they would drastically lower the price and sweeten the deal. It‚Äôs all a scam! The sales staff told me to lie about my income so that I would be approved for their loan and get a better interest rate!!! That goes to show what sort of company Diamond is‚Ä¶asking people to lie!!! There is absolutely no value in Diamond timeshares. I can‚Äôt believe they get away with what they are doing. Nothing about their timeshares makes sense, the fees increase, and you‚Äôre expected to pay them yet there is never any availability. The financial burden of their garbage timeshare has left me in a bad position both financially and mentally. I have asked them to void my timeshare and told them everything they‚Äôve done to me and all I got was a series of snarky emails and a letter giving me the run around and no solutions! I suspect that their Senior Resolutions Team is just a sham group of Diamond staff that are going to harass me to upgrade. Look at what others are saying.

Diamond Resorts - zero stars if possible,"My husband and I attended a timeshare presentation which lasted more than four hours and ended with us signing a contract with Gold Key Resorts/Ocean Beach Club/Diamond Resorts. The presentation started with a young saleswoman who talked about the resort‚Äôs Ocean Beach Club. She then shared her life story: how she was jilted at the altar and how she was dealing with that by using her timeshare to vacation on some island. The second salesman joined in on the conversation. He talked about how the timeshare was a good real estate investment and how it would save us money on vacations because we'd only have to pay a $100 fee to book our week. He didn‚Äôt touch on the maintenance fees at all. I think the saleswoman‚Äôs sob story and the salesman‚Äôs divorce were tactics because their sad stories made us empathetic towards them, and they used that empathy to get us hook, line, and sinker!  I seriously think those stories were completely made up and are used on every person they sell to. We were never told our children would inherit the debt and be responsible for the mortgage and maintenance fees. They were not open and honest with all the facts. Since buying the timeshare in August 2014, we have only used it twice: once in January 2015 and again in January 2017. Both times were an exchange with one being the Ocean Beach Club but not the unit we had purchased. The other exchange was at the Ford‚Äôs Colony by Marriott in Williamsburg, VA. After those two bookings, we weren‚Äôt able to use it because there was never availability during the summer months to do an exchange. Also, every time we called to book a trip, we are told to use the website because whatever was on the website was the same availability in their system.

Deceitful Company,"In 2010, we purchased a timeshare with a company called Island One while visiting one of their properties in Florida.  When they were purchased by Diamond Resorts, we were immediately hit with a 70% increase in maintenance fees!  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!  For the next 8 years, we were continually asked to attend Diamond‚Äôs ‚Äúmember updates‚Äù.  It didn‚Äôt take long to realize that these were just additional sales presentations where we were continuously pressured to purchase more and more points.  Every time we declined and left these meetings, we were rudely dismissed.  On one particular occasion, we were FORCED TO WALK BACK to a totally different resort because they had sent a car to pick us up earlier in the day.  What kind of company treats people this way??? When we started to have problems booking in 2020, we again attended an update meeting to solve our issues.  We were told that this was due to us not having converted into their points system.  We were specifically told that we would be able to keep our banked weeks if we converted to their points system, and that we would receive a ‚Äúdream vacation‚Äù but we would have to act that day.  There was NO MENTION of the expiration date on the points or the additional fees. And we LOST the two banked weeks. We still have problems booking the weeks we requested as owners. But we can reserve those same weeks as a private customer.  We were told the resorts were for owners only. The booking problem was not solved.  Had we been told that there was a 10-day window to cancel this, we DEFINITELY would have taken advantage of that!

I am a retired nurse with Multiple‚Ä¶,"I am a retired nurse with Multiple Sclerosis and a disabled child. My husband and I bought a timeshare with Embassy Resorts in 2001 and we had some difficulties at first but for the most part it was OK. In 2004, Embassy was bought out by Diamond Resorts and that is when everything went from bad to worse as we could never book a vacation due to lack of availability.Over the next 15 years, they kept calling us for owner‚Äôs updates, which they proceeded to upgrade our contracts to fix our availability issues and give us higher status, so we had priority bookings. One time they took our drivers licenses and held us hostage until we upgraded again! Our last upgrade in 2016 was done so we could have an ‚Äúexit plan‚Äù so our disabled child wouldn‚Äôt inherit the financial burden. Our salesperson became our ‚Äúgo to guy‚Äù, but when we reached out, he disappeared. In 2021, Hilton bought Diamond. We thought, finally a reputable company that we can work with, boy were we wrong. A salesman named Todd from Diamond tried to get us to upgrade again, telling us for $10,000 they would turn our 15-year loan into a 10-year loan, and we could refinance with a bank. They offered to open a Diamond credit card for us to handle the deposit, but we were so fed up with all the lies over the last 2 decades we walked out. A few days later these Hilton characters had opened a credit card under our names without our knowledge, consent, or permission!We pay $14,500 a year towards the mortgage and $6,500 a year on the maintenance fees, which totals $21,000 a year for a timeshare we can‚Äôt use! The stress of this financial burden could cause me to relapse and I would have to go to the hospital frequently.

Stay Away!,"Hilton Grand Vacations purchased Diamond Resorts, but it is clear they are just as corrupt as Diamond was!

Hilton, the company with a sterling reputation? Yes, thank you I thought‚Ä¶but since have learned Hilton Grand Vacations is nothing like Hilton the hotel company with the great reputation. My last misadventure with Diamond started with a salesperson who told me a series of egregious lies in order to coerce me into purchasing into the worthless Diamond timeshare system. She ran my credit without my permission, told me she would charge $2,000 to my credit card but charged $8,500 instead, that I would receive a free trip for 2 to Hawaii with accommodations and airfare, I would have access to a myriad of Disney Resort properties, and even held my ID and refused to give it back until I signed the contract. I signed the contracts but then cancelled a few days later. This is where the real harassment began. I started getting phone calls and texts from her and other staff regarding my decision to cancel. VERY unprofessional and scary. Some time after this experience I was called to schedule a meeting to hear about the Hilton takeover and my chance to get away from the Diamond scam. I got on a webinar with a salesperson who told me another series of lies to get me to buy into the HGV system. He told me that it was mandatory to buy into the HGV Max system, that if I did not I could not use my Diamond points, I would have access to HGV properties, that since it was a ‚Äúreal estate‚Äù purchase I could make money renting the points out, and I could only get the deal that day and I was not allowed to sleep on it. All of these were lies!! I asked why the contract still said Diamond and he said it was because they were still using the old Diamond contracts and assured me, I was buying out of Diamond and into HGV. I did not get a copy of this contract for almost 2 weeks which put me outside of my cancellation period for the purchase. Several weeks later, when I tried to book a stay at an HGV resort, the HGV rep told me I did not own with them at all and had been sold MORE Diamond points! I reached out to my sales rep, but he ignored me. I also reached out to another employee who had worked with me on the contract, and she said my access would be activated soon. It was not.

DON'T DO IT,"I am writing this review because I feel that the truth needs to be known about owning a timeshare with Diamond. It is a battle in trying to get your membership canceled with them. They will use any type of tactic to get you to come listen to whatever ‚Äúnew updates‚Äù they have just to try to sell you on more. The fact that you have representatives feeding you this so called dream investment and writing everything down on a scrap piece of paper to show you how easy everything is going to work. They keep you hostage and pressure you for hours. They will ask you things like how you want to vacation or why you are wanting to vacation so that they will use it to their advantage. We thought it would be a good idea to have to come together as friends and vacation. They stated that they had many ways to take advantage of all of our points including a program Destination Exchange. It is extremely hard to use and it does not work with just points but you have to be in a certain tier as well. You will have to pay extra fees to even utilize it. That is absurd considering the amount of money that you pay for the timeshare to begin with.They will make it sound like such a wonderful investment and that you will be saving so much money by investing in them. Honestly all you are doing is throwing your money in the trash. We honestly have tried to understand and make of the best of this timeshare but the lies and distrust have grown to such an extent that we realize that is all there is. They continue to press on the matter that we were in the wrong and that there was no fault done during the sell of our timeshare. Yet they were not present for what was said to us before we signed our paperwork. They stand behind the liars that day in day out that steal peoples‚Äô money by selling the fake dream vacations. I would not want to wish this nightmare on our children, which is why we will continue to fight against all the dishonesty that Diamond allows its representatives to get away with.

The parking garage is dangerous especially if you don't watch out in turning up or down to the next level, you might put a dent in your car turning. The room was average.  Our air conditioner did not work.  Called for service to fix and worked for one day only of the 5 days we stayed.  Left 2 days early, just could not take it anymore.  Had a sales person tell us when we went for our time share appointment that they would not stay there.  They would of stayed up the street at the other resort of Diamonds!!  Our grand daughter accidently forgot her necklace and left it in the bathroom on the vanity ledge and did not realize it until the next morning and we were in Maryland.  We called the front desk and did not receive a call back so my wife called later in the day only to find out they checked and could not find it.  Asked to check again, we knew it had been left and we knew the room had not been filled at that point since our week did not end until Friday and this was only Thursday.  Again, no response.  I cannot put blame, but someone cleaned that room and found it I am sure.  That necklace was given to my grand daughter with her mothers birthstone and it said MOM.

When we actually booked we were treated like the dirt on the bottom of the reps shoes and only would give us 3 nights, first in a 2 star hotel as rated on Tripadvisor.

Unhappy with Diamond Resorts,"Our health issues didn‚Äôt dissuade Diamond and Hilton to sell us multiple timeshares while we are in our 80‚Äôs.  My husband has bladder cancer, PAD, and heart problems.  We enjoyed Diamond Resorts with family and friends for 12 years before salespeople started to promise that we could redeem points to help pay for Diamond loans and maintenance fees. We were then pressured into buying more and more points telling us that we could redeem some of our points to pay maintenance fees as well as Diamond mortgage which is at a ridiculous rate (12% to 17%).  Diamond salespeople told us we would be able to refinance with a bank for a lower rate.  NOT TRUE! A year or so later, we were told that if we went to Platinum level, we could redeem up to half of our points to pay 30 cents per point for maintenance fee and Diamond mortgage.  This convinced us to become Platinum level.  Less than a year later we were convinced by salespeople at Branson that by becoming Centum level we could now redeem 40 cents per point to pay for fees and loans.  This meant we could redeem half our points which leaves half our points for reservations at 50% off as told to us by the salespeople.  The documentation was entered on the contract incorrectly by the Branson purchase by giving us credit for two Club Select units instead of one.  We have only one Club Select Unit.  We received a call from Diamond Corporate in Las Vegas telling us about the ""mistake"" made in Branson was incorrect and we were NOT Centum.  In order to become Centum with all the benefits, we needed to make another purchase.  It is obvious by now that we were being lied to many times by every salesperson we encountered.  To this date, the 30 cents or 40 cents per point redemption has never happened. In addition to the above lies, we were told that the price per point would increase substantially after Hilton purchased Diamond which influenced further purchases.  In order to be a part of Hilton we were told that we must make another purchase, which we did.  Later we were told that we still need another purchase to become Hilton.  They always found something wrong, and we needed another purchase. We must have been easy targets. The only reason we continued to purchase points was because Diamond promised redemption and Hilton membership.  The redemption as stated never happened.  We were perfectly happy with being Gold level, but the salespersons made us feel terrible if we ""passed up this great deal"". Our grown children looked into timeshare ownership and told us that they are not interested in inheriting Diamond or Hilton timeshare. The lies we were told at each presentation were not stated in the sales contract.  They always referred to a presentation as an owner update which in reality was a sales pitch to pressure us into purchasing more points.  We believed what the salespeople told us at each presentation only to find out that most of what they were telling us was NOT TRUE! For the amount of money we have spent over the years, we could have had great vacations for a lot less by other means.

We received the same discussion from last March 2021, that they had tried to contact us on Hilton Max Pre Inventory Option and that we were unresponsive but they could maybe go back and still make us the same deal on points. They said that they sent it to us by registered mail.  They then followed normal procedure that as soon as we finally got them to understand that we didn't need any additional points, he said thanks and that another salesman would come over to finish things up and release us.   When other salesman came in, he almost immediately started to selling us another deal for buying additional points.  After about an hour he wore us down and I said ok.  I thought that I would have the normal 10 days to cancel.  He went through the contact with a small I Pad and we were ask to just hit the spot on the screen to sign it.  He was very good about going through each of the items.  At that time, I thought that we would have a period of time to think about what we were purchasing and then turn it down if we were not happy.  When I go home, I went through the contract and just above the last signature line, there was a sentence that there was not right of recession, cancellation, or refund as this was not a timeshare purchase.  Never once did the salesperson go over that statement while reviewing the contract.   I call Diamond Resort as soon as I was at home.  I talk to a representative who after explaining everything to him, said that he would send my complaint to appropriate people and somebody would call me back in 3 to 4 days.  I asked to talk to somebody in the contract group and he said that there was nobody available.  I received a call 4 days after.

Overview of our stay at the Flamingo‚Ä¶,"Overview of our stay at the Flamingo Beach Resort, St Maarten.We checked into our rooms hoping to get an ocean front room.  Very view people get ocean front room apparently.  We were put in the worst room up in the hillside Bldg 3 room.  We were they for a ten day stay.  First morning we woke up to water pouring out of the ceiling in the bedroom on the lock off side.  We used all the towels in both rooms to soak up the water on the floor.  It had already soaked the bed, clothes in closet and bathroom floor.  Also water dripping from the main kitchen ceiling, but not as bad.  I found a mop and bucket outside of our room and start to use it.  Water was coming in faster that we could mop up.  Then a jack hammer started in the unit above us.  Obviously there was a problem with the pipes, but they still put us in the room below.  We immediately went down to the front desk to speak with a supervisor and get another room.  We supposedly were speaking with a supervisor who told us ‚Äúno problem‚Äù just go back and pack our bags and he will send a bellman to move us to the new rooms.  After waiting 45 minutes for the bellman, we hiked (yes it is a hike) to the front office.  The ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù we spoke with was not in and NO ONE knew anything about moving us to a new room.  Every time we went to the front desk, NO ONE knew anything about us.  How frustrating?  We had to wait for the ‚Äúsupervisor‚Äù to come back.  We waited all morning, still no room.  About 1pm we said we were going to get lunch and he said he would have a new room for us (you think they would have at the very least comped our lunch, but no).  After lunch, he gave us the keys to two new rooms and the keys did not work.  One again we hiked down to the office and he gave us new keys.  Went back to the new room and second set of keys would not work.  Knocked on the door and someone answered.  They had given out these rooms the day before.  How do they not know this.. We went down to the office once again and they still did not have a room for us.  We spent the first entire day of our vacation waiting for a poorly run front desk to find us rooms. After we finally got into our new rooms we went down to the beach about 5:00.  We had several beach chairs set up on the beach.  We were in the water and I looked up on the beach towards our chairs and some employee was taking them to lock up stating the beach was closing.  What in the world, 5:30pm 95 degrees outside and the beach is closing.  Then on the third day, my son realized he had left his expensive razor and other items in the bathroom in the room we had moved from.  We went down to the front office and they said they would check into it.  After a day we checked back with the front office and they had no idea what we were talking about.  They referred us to housekeeping.  Housekeeping referred us to security.  Security referred us to housekeeping and so on.  We spend other day trying to track down these items.  We just wanted whoever took them, to turn them back in.  They were never found..Then on our 7th day of our stay, all of our keys stopped working.  Mind you every time they gave us new keys on the first day they kept messing up the length of our stay.  I went down to the front desk again and she said I had to have all of the old keys to give me new keys.  How impossible is that?  So I can not get into my room because the rest of my party is out and about.   This was one of the worst vacations we have had in a long time.  Very disappointed in Diamond Resorts.  This is not a 4-star resort.  Would not even rate it a 1-star.  Was very disappointed in the way we were treated by the staff all around.  Not that this will matter to anyone, and I usually never say anything, but I had too.  I was so angry and frustrated with the whole vacation.  I never had any resolution to this so I will keep posting.Kathi C",US,1,0,"{'neg': 0.058, 'neu': 0.909, 'pos': 0.033, 'compound': -0.9778}",-0.9778
I took a tour of the diamond resorts‚Ä¶,"I took a tour of the diamond resorts program in Virginia Beach.It started off okay, with a question lurking in the back of my mind whether or not I was believed by my host.  Right from the start, my host said multiple times that he wanted to be sure that there was no pressure, as the FTC or Federal trade commission wanted to assure diamond resorts did not pressure anyone. So I listen to the plan, and it left me with questions that I needed to have answered from outside sources before I signed a contract. The man walked me downstairs and asked me to sit at the table where another woman came out who is apparently supposed to close the deal which I had not agreed to. The woman came over and she was rude on multiple levels. I told her truthfully that I needed to do some research for a day or two before I decided on signing a contract and at one point, she so rudely just snaps at me and I do mean snaps at me, how do you make a decision in life how do you even buy a shirt? She also just blatantly says to me when she asked me a question that I answered truthfully about   about where I stayed if I went somewhere that I'm a liar and no I don't do it. d it was a condescending acting like she knew anything about my life when she didn't kind of a way. y. She had one of those kinds of tones on multiple occasions during the conversation where she was just mad that I said I had to think over something that was going to cost me any amount of money and lock me into any kind of a contract. So she then goes and gets another guy who sits down with me and he offers me this, which I'm sure you're going to understand why this left me with a very bad feeling about this . So he tells me that he will only charge me $118 a month for 2 years and I'm locked in at that price for the duration with the company, earlier, my first host said that I could do five times per year some sort of 60 minute presentation which would waive all the maintenance fees and also at the end they would give me a $300 gift card every single time so I would end up with $1,500 and no maintenance fees each year. I was also going to go in at the silver level which is higher than the standard level and I was going to get  15,000 points.. sounds too good to be true because I'm being paid to actually sign on to  their program, right? Well the thing that had gotten to me, is that I had honestly said I needed time to think about whether or not it would be a good plan for me, and both this man and the very rude woman before and even my first host but he just had a little bit more decorum than the woman, they had a problem with it that I actually wanted to talk to other people and then come back and make a decision then. Talk about pressure.. if your company has a good product, you're not going to force your customer to make a decision in a 2-hour presentation that they cannot get out of. It's just       b a d business. And in fact, just to get out of there sooner, I even told the very rude woman as politely as I could that I was fine with forfeiting the gifts that have been offered to me to come do the presentation if I could just leave. So that's when she got up and went to talk to the other guy, who I politely explained why it was that I needed time to       think things over and he irritatedly although it was more polite  than the first woman, escorted me to the front desk. I was given an envelope with a MasterCard gift card in it and I asked if it had my $40 deposit that was required that they said that they would refund. The woman said no, that it was $100 gift card and they return the money to my credit card. I thanked her and left, but then I went to the parking garage I was instructed To park in?And that man told me they had nothing to do with diamond resorts and I owe $20. Well I did get the same woman to validate my parking, which she should have done from the start. And I didn't particularly want to go back into that building. and what have I done with  the free oh wait no it wasn't free the $300 vacation that they offered - which was basically a week-long stay in a hotel for $300? Nothing I ripped it up. I also broke the credit card in half and would love to post a picture of it because I didn't spend ai dime off of it. I don't care what you're selling, but if you treat a potential customer badly, particularly the kind of customer I am?

Terrible Experience at The Daytona Beach Regency,"We stayed at The Daytona Beach Regency by Diamond Resort on December 18-21 2020.  We arrived late the first night, and upon arriving the room smelled like smoke terribly.  I have asthma and allergies, so it made breathing unbearable.  I phoned the front desk to let them know and they said all rooms were booked, and sent maintenance up.  They changed the air filter and sprayed some cheap fragrance all over the carpet in an attempt to cover the smell.  It just made matters worse.  I phoned the front desk first thing in the morning and demanded that we be moved.  We were moved to another room, but that room wasn't the best smelling either.  It was better than the last, so we stayed.  Even the hallways had a stinky. moldy smell, and you could smell the cheap fragrance throughout.  Instead of replacing the carpets which desperately needs to be done, they keep spraying them to try and cover the smell.  Our room's carpet was also stained pretty bad.  There were things missing from the kitchen that have always been in every room of a Diamond Resort, and just general maintenance was lacking.  Our shower door was broken off the hinge, and my husband just went ahead and fixed it instead of us calling the front desk. The shower door would of been obviously visible when they cleaned the bathroom. I have always had a great experience at The Cove at Ormond Beach, and since it is practically down the street, I will always stay there, and will not go back to the Daytona Beach location.

When we arrived, we told the sales rep that we were vacationing with our children and that they were alone in the room waiting for us so we could only spend the allocated one hour.  We also told him that we were not interested in making a purchase, but he was quick to assure us that there were amazing deals in place due to the pandemic.  We told him that our income had been severely impacted by the pandemic, yet the continued to push forward.  It was like he couldn‚Äôt hear us.  After saying no for hours, we finally relented, especially since we were told that there would be NO ADDITIONAL FEES after the price we were given.   Our children had been alone for over four hours and we were anxious to get back to them as well.  When we visited the Palm Canyon resort in August to attend an owners update, we learned about maintenance fees.  Since we were told that there were no additional fees, we asked to cancel the contract.  The employees laughed at us and told us that there was no way out!

Untruthful presentation and statements.,"In 2018, my family visited Liki Tiki Village in Orlando.  Upon check-in we were directed to Member Services and were asked to attend a 1-hour sales presentation in exchange for a gift card.  We were in the sales center for hours, being pressured by their employees to make a purchase.  This took far longer than the one hour advertised, which left our son on the play area for an extended time.   We left that presentation feeling like we had made an investment in the future for our family.  When we tried to use points for a trip, we were sent to a ‚Äúmember update‚Äù which was really just another sales presentation.  We were told that an upgrade of our status would allow us to sell this membership if we ever wanted to no longer be owners.  Since that day, we have learned that everything they told us was a lie, we cannot sell this or even give it back, we were misled about maintenance fees, and the true value of our purchase was not disclosed.

Don‚Äôt do a Diamond Resort Time share‚Ä¶,"Don‚Äôt do a Diamond Resort Time share presentation.  You will regret it.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong vacationing is GREAT.  Don‚Äôt fall into the pay in advance scheme.  Because then you‚Äôll pay to get out.  Not worth it.  I checked into the a Diamond resort and  expressed that I was not interested in doing a presentation.  I was assured that Diamond was no longer doing presentations do to COVID-19.  (LIE #1) Later on the way to contract I saws more than a dozen couples at presentation tables  with sales associates.  (LIE #2) I was told that I could see someone to help me save the points I was not able to use this year due to COVID and that is all they wanted to help owners with right now. (LIE #3) I agreed because I was also told that I would not be kept more than 45 minutes because of a new State Governor mandate.  (LIE #4) Then she wrote no more than one hour on my slip.  (LIE #5) It was very clear that I was lied to when I arrived at the appointed time and sat down.  I was kept for 5 & ¬Ω hours and was played on to purchase additional points.  I was caught up in the fear they presented and did everything he said out of fear.  Let me explain a bit of the 5 & 1/2 hours.  After disappearing for 20 minutes, the salesman returned to tell me that my account had been flagged because I failed to respond to a letter that had been mailed to me at the beginning of the year.  (LIE #6) I asked why the account was flagged and he explained that it is not normal for someone to not accept the invitation to save money.  (LIE #7) I was curious but very suspicious.  I should have left.They explained that Apollo sent out a letter pre COVID (Lie #9) informing owners that their maintenance fees would be going up 12.5 percent every year.  (Lie #10) He wasn‚Äôt supposed to tell me that Apollo purchased Diamond.  (LIE #11) Would I not have known about the Apollo purchase when the letter came, if I had received it?  Anyway, he told me that my maintenance fees would end up being over 120,000.00 dollars over the next 10 years.  WHAT!?  (LIE #12)  I explained that that was insane and that it would price people out of ownerships including me. Then he proceeded to threaten me and tell me that I was locked into my agreements and that if I tried to back out that a lean would be placed on my house and my credit wrecked.  (Truth #1?) So we spent the next hour talking about how that the purchase of Platinum for 90,000.00 dollars would eliminate all future maintenance fees for life including (LIE #13)  through legacy (LIE #14) as long as I used 29,000 points every year (LIE #15) and that those points would be credited to my account as credit towards full maintenance. (Lie #16) Thus eliminating my yearly maintenance.  (Lie #17) How is that possible I asked over and over and he explained that all Diamond wanted owners to do was go on vacation because they would spend money.  (I can‚Äôt believe I fell for this)I couldn‚Äôt find any about this on the paperwork I received.  Because of this I returned the next morning.   I questioned him again about the maintenance fee credits for life as part of going platinum and he again assured me that It was in fact there in writing and a very real part of the program. (Lie #17)  Before I went to contract, I was prepped on what to say and what not to say.  I was told not to mention the credits towards maintenance or that would raise the price of the program.  I was told to only say that I wanted additional points for benefits, and to go platinum.  (Now they are asking me to lie #18)There‚Äôs a lot more detail that includes additional lies and sales tactics used to place pressure and fear that I will not go onto.  Don‚Äôt fall for this trap.

Do not buy in!,"Do not buy in! Diamond does not care about its consumers what so ever and is only concerned that they get your money. They will have you sit down with them persuaded by free money or a cruise and then they will lie to your face over and over. You will say no we can't afford that and yet they will continue to pressure you and present you with offer after offer. Then they will send other people over to try and get you to buy in. While they dont hold you at gunpoint or tie you to a chair, you will most definitely feel as though you'd just been held hostage. After hours you will sign almost anything just to get on with your vacation. I imagine you can just get up and leave but for an honest and respectful individual you feel like it'd be rude to get up or maybe you've always wanted to go on a cruise and this is your one chance. Just dont do it. It is not worth anything they offer.For the last 2 years or so my husband and I have felt mistreated and misled by diamond over and over again. I find it almost comical at this point when I get e-mails from Diamond warning people not to go to third party timeshare cancellation companies when it feels as though we are getting pushed in that direction by Diamond. We have gone on one actual trip since becoming members/owners in Diamond. I have spent hours on the phone trying to get in contact with cancellations in the spring of 2019 just to finally talk to someone about having it cancelled and she told me we would either have to sell it or if we waited a year there was a program where essentially it could be cancelled and Diamond wouldn't owe us anything and we wouldn't owe them anything. I did this after having several complications with Diamond. After waiting about a year I called Diamond and asked about this program and was sent to the sunrise ridge resort to what we thought was going to be a meeting to discuss our issues and the potential to get out of Diamond, but instead they tried to get us to buy more points and were being very deceptive about the whole situation. We then were completely mislead into getting a sampler, which after several months of trying to get it resolved, has finally been resolved.It seems that no one there understands that at this time I don't think we can even afford to continue paying for diamond. It continues to affect our quality of life and cause us undue stress. A little over a week ago we had a phone meeting with a customer service vice president who really did not act like she wanted to hear me out or just blatantly did not care we've had issues from the get go. She said I'm not refunding something after 2 years while we've been attempting this for the last 2 years. She said let me help you find a resolution and asked me where we wanted to go on vacation like that solves our problems. She was either trying to blame us or make us feel dumb for going to the last meeting. We weren't even asking for a refund, they can keep the money we've spent to go nowhere and cancel our membership. That is what we want. It's not as if our points wont be sold to some other individual who has no idea what they are signing up for. We feel as though Dimond is selling the idea of a vacation or ownership and not anything truly tangible.",US,1,0,"{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.094, 'compound': 0.9413}",0.9413

Diamond Resorts' outstanding staff - they go the extra mile!,"2020 has been a challenging year, to say the least, and it is in the tough times that the true measure of individuals and organizations can be taken.  One is happy to share highest praise of the Diamond Resorts organization in the time of Covid, particularly the outstanding, caring and mission-focused staff of Alhambra at Poinciana in Osceola County, FL. As the entire nation, and indeed world, was upended by mid-March, under the leadership of A @P Manager Sarah W., supported by Meaghan her Asst. Manager, office staff Isa and Nicky, housemen/maintenance Christian and Julio, and security staff, all worked hard and with success to maintain their hospitality and safety mission with professionalism, caring and guest service until the last guest had departed safely. (Diamond Resorts also provided lodging for first line medical staff during that early, scary time, an act of corporate good citizenship of which many may not be aware.)  In a time when, generally, too many are quick to criticize and too slow to defend, thank and highlight preferred companies and their hardworking employees, I am happy to give deserved praise to Diamond Resorts and its Alhambra @ Poinciana outstanding staff who go the extra mile.  One was truly overwhelmed in March by the uncertainties created by the virus, and DR's staff went the extra mile to make it all work out for myself and all their other guests.  If Diamond Resorts performs so commendably in times of extreme stress, imagine how well they will continue to deliver when more normal times have returned!  Diamond Resorts provides well-stocked, well-maintained, very clean properties with great staffing, imho, and of the several choices in their hospitality category, in my experience they deserve your business and support.

Bad Business Ethics,"I booked a 4 day, 3 night stay with Diamond Resorts international one month ago against my better judgement. I told the salesman, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not worth buying a package because I‚Äôll never find good dates available at your resorts,‚Äù and he responded, (direct quote) ‚Äúas long as you don‚Äôt call our Las Vegas location on December 20th to book a trip for New Years, you will always get a spot even at our most popular destinations. As long as you book a month or so ahead of time, we always have availability - no black out dates.‚Äù After that my wife and I talked with a couple of friends and planned to book a trip less than one month after securing the vacation package. On September 27th, (more than 3 month of advanced timing) I reached out to our travel agent to book a trip to Las Vegas (where diamond resorts owns 3 resorts) for New Years And was told that they had no availability. Diamond Resorts owns resorts in Las Vegas, yet not one available unit with 3 months of advanced notice. When I complained at the agent because of their false promises, he didn‚Äôt seem to care - no options to get my money back or cancel this package based on false promises.Then when I asked if they could tell me which resorts were available on New Years so I could consult with my wife about other locations, he let me know that‚Äôs not how it works and that we have to pick the location and then he can check - seems to be a stupid process and it has left me looking foolish to my wife and our friends because I got all of our hopes up for a Vegas New Years trip.I won‚Äôt be using this service again. More than 3 months of advance notice in a location where they own 3 resorts and they couldn‚Äôt come through for me.

An incredible first experience in Zihua,"What to say and where to start.

Zihua was always in our plans but the problem was that we have to book 11 months in advance and since we were unable to plan that much in advance so finally last year we started our preretirement so we jumped on the occasion and bang we made our reservation for two weeks in Zihua for February 2020 just before the pandemic. What an amazing resort so much different from the others in many aspects. You feel at home from day one, very nice welcoming from the staff, quick service, a restaurant in the resort, a bar in the pool and the beach is just there. Many activities are offered on site like Loteria (Mexican Bingo), Mexican night dinner and show, painting on clay or wood‚Ä¶ and the reception can guide you for some discoveries around the resort plus some tours to Ixtapa, La Saladita, Archeological Site & Museum, Troncones. We have even spent one day in Acapulco (4 hours‚Äô drive). It‚Äôs so much fun to go make your own shopping of fresh food from the Mercada Municipal and meeting the local people there is priceless. Some restaurants in downtown are a must visit like Any Restaurant. You have also one major supermarket called the Mega Soriana. Beside the activities that take place almost every night in the down town specially in the weekend at the so called the Basketball court where you can walk along the seaside and take photos of the famous mermaid. Most of the members that we met there are frequent if not yearly returning members and this explains why at the reception when you make the check-out the staff asks you if you already reserved your room for the coming year, which I have never heard from any other resort reception staff. Of course we will never forget the exercise that we have to make 5-6 times per day between our room and pool or the beach or to go out of the resort, since we had to climb 122 steps each way but of course there is a Golf cart that can take you to your floor and back.

Response to my vacation stay!,"Hello! I am an owner of over 12 years at Beach Quarters and my stay was good outside of a few issues.

After 7 years membership‚Ä¶now a disgruntled member,"For the first 6 years (2013 - mid 2019) it was a worthwhile membership, with the most beneficial aspect being the attractive, inexpensive resort availability (cash option or points) offered to me under the Club Select program.  During this period, I rated my membership at 5 stars.However, changes implemented since late 2019 have now caused me to question the wisdom of my membership.  Unfavorable changes include discontinuance of former Club Select availability, and increases to most Diamond Loyalty Benefits fees, done surreptitiously without advance notification to membership.  The explanations offered after the fact were at best misleading, if not downright deceitful.  DR's explanation that discontinuance of the Club Select Program was to make searches simpler & easier for members, is at variance with my own personal experience.  The major difference that I can see is that resorts that were previously available to me for $400 - $ 500 were subsequently available to me through the simpler/easier search program for $2,000 - $4,000.  Aside from being much more costly, it was not even simpler or easier.  Simply put, it was a cash grab!!Resort availability now available to me through my DR points or cash options, are available to me through other agencies (RCI, II etc.) at much more affordable rates.I am now feeling more like a ""cash cow"" for DR, rather then as a valued member.It is still to be determined whether the new Destination Exchange Tier Program will be more of a benefit to me or to DR.  I recognize the obvious  benefit of deferring annual point usage into a 5 year time frame. However,  some of the limitations & restrictions in tier points leads me to believe that DR will ultimately prove to be the major benefactor through points still unused.Please feel free to share my review with all DR members.

Cancun Resort experience,"Every yr we would vacation at Cancun Resort in Nevada, this yr 2020 was the worst experience. June 18th, I made it in 2 hrs early before check in time so i went to do pre check-in. No room ready yet didn‚Äôt have what I requested for either (strip view) so I requested mountain view but she recommended pool view instead, I asked to be notify as soon as there‚Äôs a room available. Past 4 pm and no call, drove back to resort, finally got room key. Drove to garage to access elevator and there were puke by the door. Got to our floor, the hallway and room had bad odor thru out our entire stay. There were no sponge in the room, called customer service, they stated that they were out of stock which is not acceptable when inventories should be kept at par to maintain business. Saturday night june 20th, my daughter (5yrs old) came back to resort with her aunt and had to witness a drunk customer peeing by the garage elevator door. Unsanitary. Next morning, I was told of incident, i asked if it was reported, my sister said it must have cause another customer was there to point it out. I checked the area and didn‚Äôt look like it was clean or wash off.  Could had at least make it look deceit. Every time when i would call for supplies for room, there was alway something incorrect. Every night they‚Äôll be customers in parking lot drunk or walking around. Need better security system. We pay maintenance fee and for our timeshare every yr not to have a bad vacation experience.

Diamond Resorts Deceptive sales practices,"In August of 2018 my family vacationed in Florida, using my fatherinlaw‚Äôs Diamond resorts timeshare. We were required to attend a sales presentation. The agents gave us numbers that were way too high. We explained there was no way we could afford it, we were living paycheck to paycheck with 3 teenage daughters. The floor manager came back with something we thought we could afford and offered us a dream holiday for 2 people to go to Hawaii for free, including airfare. That was huge for us in making this decision. We said we would want to bring our kids too. They told us that we would just have to pay a few hundred dollars per kid. We were sold on the Dream vacation to Hawaii. We purchased 7500 points for a 10 year term product. They said it was a basic membership. Our monthly payment would be $207 a month and around $875 a year for maintenance fees. We didn‚Äôt have the money for the $3366 down payment, so they had us apply for a Barclaycard to charge $1959 down and finance the balance of the down payment at $214 a month for 6 months before starting loan payments. A few months later we called to book the trip to Hawaii. It was a nightmare. We could not have 5 people in the room for the ‚Äúfree‚Äù trip. We would have to get 2 rooms. It would cost anywhere from $4000 to $6000. I was more than irritated, let down mentally and felt taken advantage of. We were stuck, we signed on the dotted line. This trip was one of the main reasons we said yes to the timeshare. December of 2018 we accepted a free weekend getaway for the Red Lion in St. Louis supposedly to learn how to use our points. It was 4 months after we had purchased our timeshare. It ended up being a sales presentation. They are only interested in making more money not helping you to use the timeshare you own. In July of 1999 we booked a trip to Florida using my father in laws timeshare again.  We stayed at Mystic Dunes. One of the customer service girls said that if we met with the sales team we would get a free trip. I was angry. I wanted to cancel the membership. The Florida sales person informed us that we had purchased a starter plan that needed to be upgraded to full membership. He was confused because he couldn‚Äôt find us in the system. He said if we didn‚Äôt upgrade we would have wasted our money and wouldn‚Äôt be able to use our membership‚Äôs full potential. He said what we bought wasn‚Äôt even a real membership. Most things we wouldn‚Äôt be able to do. He said that if we upgraded, even if we didn‚Äôt go on trips every year, we could purchase airfare, gift cards, and get cash back. There were alot of options. We felt like we didn‚Äôt have much choice. We had paid so far about $6000 for what we were told was useless. We had to pay another $1200 for the down payment and other fees to upgrade. The program costs us double monthly than what we had been paying, and another large down payment was put on credit cards for basically the same amount of points. Our new payment is $408 a month and maintenance fees went up to $1856 a year. After upgrading the plan, we ended up with 22500 points. If we don‚Äôt use the points by the end of 2020 we will lose all but 7500 points. That is like losing 2 years of points. We have a wedding in Cancun scheduled for October of 2020. When I searched through diamond resorts there are no rooms available. When I searched online through Priceline, there were rooms available, when I worked through the resort they had rooms available. I am sick to my stomach. I can‚Äôt sleep and mentally struggle trying to figure out why we are going through this. We are honest, hard working people. We don‚Äôt deserve this. We have been scammed and lied to. What we had before was not worthless. We could have used that program. Instead we have an outstanding loan of $23516 as of May 2020.  We have paid in over $12000 past 2 years and have not been able to use our timeshare membership. All we have gotten from this membership is a huge headache and a lot of empty promises. I felt obligated because I signed on the dotted line but then realized these company ‚Äúconsultants‚Äù have been far from honest. I feel violated and honestly pretty angry. We have been lied to on so many different levelsIf you want to be lied to and cheated sign up for a timeshare with diamond resort.

Service not what expected,"I‚Äôve stayed at the Ridge in Sedona on several occasions and have always felt it is the most enjoyable Diamond property in Sedona.

Not valued as year round owners,"We are owners who do not often use our week, we deposit and exchange it for a more convenient time at The Historic Powhatan resort. We have owned this week through several companies over the past 25 or so years. The resort itself is beautiful, the units have what is needed and look inviting. Diamond no longer treats owners as owners, they have imposed an amenities fee for all exchange guests through RCI. I explained I was an owner to the check in manager, who stated it was required I pay this fee (despite being current on my maintenance fees), and to call RCI as they put my reservation through incorrectly as it did not show ownership at a Diamond property let alone the one he is managing! I did so, even though it sounded absurd, and it wasn‚Äôt an incorrect reservation just an exchange of my week to another at the same property. As I do own five weeks, I prefer RCI to any one company who has an internal exchange as I would need to manage my time with all companies separately.

Upon purchase I was told I could use their amenities year round even if not staying on the property. Now I am staying there, being lied to by mgmt, and feel double billed.

The thing about my timeshare is that I‚Ä¶,"The thing about my timeshare is that I use it. Every year. I think the people who don't like their timeshare is because they don't use it. I own in the Hawaii package. I bought my timeshare in 1999. It was Embassy Suites back then. It was nice. Then Sunterra took over and things got difficult. The resort was still nice, the people at the counters were not very willing to help. The management was a challenge. Since Diamond took over things were made a lot easier. The management support staff has been great. From house keeping, to front desk, to people helping with my bookings, everyone has been great to work with. The last few years I have been booking my trips short notice and my points have gone a lot farther. Kauai has been half price. Southern states in the late spring are about a quarter of the amount of points. I have been booking golfing road trips during May using short notice (59 days or less). I have been going to Palm Springs, Scottsdale, Sedona, and Las Vegas all back to back. Checking out of one and back into the next one on the same day. It's been great. Back in 1999 it was a lot cheaper. If you are looking to buy a timeshare, I would say go with Diamond. If you are thinking about buying a timeshare, I would say don't do it. There are a lot better options out there using online bookings. Vacation rentals by owner,  Air BNB, and such. My biggest complaint is that once you buy you are stuck with it. You have to pay the high maintenance fee costs. (mine are over $3000 a year) I am going to retire soon and be living on a fixed income. One time I asked the sales person in Sedona during our owners update, how to get out of it and he said to commit suicide. In Palm Springs the sales lady said that even when I die it is automatically going to be passed on down to my kids and they will have to continue to pay the maintenance fees. So I usually don't care for the sales people. But the resort staff is great at every resort I've been to. Again. If you are thinking of purchasing a timeshare, don't do it.

Good And Bad About Diamond Resorts,"We love Diamond Resorts especially their customer support and service. We appreciate Diamond allowing us to switch our dates during the Covid-19.

Not all, but many of them will lie to get you to buy. They lie in a way that they cannot be detected in their sales pitches. No one is there to hear what they offer-illustration-we were told by the sales agent if we became Gold Members we could use points to pay maintenance fees. LIE-only Platinum Members. And in the quality control meetings when signing contracts they NEVER talk about it. You sign off on a plethora of items-Yes, I checked it off, not knowing, the one that said only Platinum Members can use points for maintenance fees, but you see the sales persons (not all) don't care about you-it's your money-not you. They tell you they are all about helping you, but they LIE-they only want to help themselves. If you could do away with some of the Sales people (not all) it would be a great company. AND, the folks in Las Vegas don't care about you either. They just brush you off and stand by the LIARS who do the selling. I am tired of typing! I could go on. I would get out today if I could-but you are legally stuck after you sign those contracts so read all the small print you need to read with a magnifying glass. My family loved Diamond before Apollo Global got their hands on it.

I have been spoken to disrespectful and the last gentlemen refused to give me his name. To date I still am not sure that my reservation has been canceled and a refund has not been issued for the luxury hotel my son and family were meant to stay at and needed to cancel do to Covid 19.

"To Whom This May Concern,","To Whom This May Concern,     First off i hope this doesn't fall on deaf ears but i would like to tell you about a very uneventful experirnce my wife and i had at one of your hotels that we stayed at for our visit to Las Vegas. We visited Las Vegas for our 10th Wedding Anniversary January 23 - 27 and stayed at Polo Towers on the Las Vegas Strip.We were there to celebrate our anniversary and to re-new our wedding vows and to have a great vacation. We were expecting everything to go great and were looking forward to a amazing experience. Well things started off well when we were able to check in early since the room was available. The check in agent was very pleasant and made check in easy. Then we were directed to the concirege, Cory, and he started to tell us about places to see, places to visit and places to eat. Then he suggested we partake in a presentation for a Timeshare if you will, and we would be rewarded some free gifts and after all who doesn't like free things. He told us that there were no obligations on our part to particapate in this presentation so we said we would check it out. We were told all we needed to do is listen for 2 hours and then we would be on our way. The presentation started off well with a breakfast and our salesman Jesse was very nice and polite. When we informed him from the begining that we would not be purchasing anything today he then turned pushy and slightly irritated. After telling him a few times we were not interested, after the 2 hours was up, he then pushed another salesman on us who was just as pushy and rude. He kept asking us over and over again ""Why do you come to these if you are not going to purchase?"" getting right in my face and being very aggressive. Now when he didn't succeed in selling us a timeshare he got another saleman who was the worst of them all. While trying to leave the presentation the saleman told me i was being very disrespectful to him but he was the one being disrespectful to my wife and I as he brushed up against me as he walked by me while i was talking to him. A few words were exchanged and then he hands my wife the paperwork for the free gifts and says in a degrading tone ""Here, go get your hundred dollars"" like we really needed it. When we left we tried to confide in the concirege who set us up on this presentation and when I started to talk he cut me off and handed me a form and said to fill it out and send it to Corporate office. So now feeling rejected by the hotel we were guests at we left, picked up our free gifts  and tried to enjoy the day we had planned. Later that evening we met up with the presentation Leader Tammy and she tried to do right by us and offered us $50.00 more in restaurant vouchers which was nice but still didn't make everything ok. I am letting you know all this to make you aware that i was not the only couple in this group that felt disrespected and degraded because we didn't purchase a timeshare. Now if they are trying to make sales they are going about it all wrong and really need to have some more training on respect, personality and generally being nice to the guests.",US,2,0,"{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.122, 'compound': 0.9832}",0.9832

Since this is addressed to Gail (who by‚Ä¶,"Since this is addressed to Gail (who by the way is not a member, she was our guest over a year ago), I am writing with regard to her experience.  We had saved points to book rooms at the Scottsdale Villa Mirage for our son's wedding so that many family members (9 suites) could stay together at the same location.  We visited the facility about 6 months in advance and were told that it would be no problem to accomodate special requests, we just needed to work with the facility. We made the bookings with the request that the rooms be grouped together, and that two of the rooms be on the bottom floor due to mobility problems, and followed up to confirm about a month in advance.  As it turned out, the rooms couldn't have been farther apart, and only one of the rooms was on the ground floor, which caused mobility challenges for the groom's grandparents.

Next best thing to a Ponzi scheme,"The initial investment in DRI (Silver member) seemed like a wonderful opportunity to enhance our travel experiences, and a number of them have been outstanding.

That coupled with the ever increasing, high cost annual maintenance fees (we pay over $11,000 annually for the privilege of being owners) has convinced me that DRI is running something like a Ponzi scheme, where each new investor/investment is used to sustain the lavish financial and other benefits afforded to its sales personnel (there sure are a lot of them) and its management.  We now realize that we could have afforded as many wonderful travel experiences paying out of pocket versus dumping our money into the DRI rabbit hole.  They say hindsight is 20/20, and we wish we had been more ""eyes open"" as we were led down the rosy path to continued investments in DRI.  And, our children will never see the benefit as none of them can afford to pay the annual maintenance fee to maintain ownership.

I am a disgruntled owner,"I am a disgruntled owner. We spent a small fortune to accumulate 50,000 points per year several years ago, after going to a presentation that explained the travel benefits ‚Äî specifically being able to use points for airfare and hotels at 100% if booked by the deadline each year. A couple of years ago, we received notice that this was going to be phased out and the points could only be exchanged for 30% of the cost. Considering the need to book through Diamond travel and the plethora of red-eye and extremely early morning flights, we already were hard-pressed to find travel times that would work with family schedules two and three time zones away. There was no explanation for decreasing this benefit. I‚Äôd like to know why it was taken away.  We have fees that increase every year despite how well Diamond is doing, yet we are losing benefits.

Having a very large selection of places to stay without having to do an ""exchange"" is particularly beneficial to us, and was a key reason for acquiring more points.  Most of the places are quite wonderful and staff excellent t.  A few, mostly ""partners"" don't really provide much of a special experience typical for Diamond Resorts, but still are nice places to stay.  The single most unsatisfactory aspect, however, is the pressure sales to buy more points.  So often we have been asked to attend an ""owner update"" with promises there will be no sales pitch, only to end up in a very high pressure sales meeting.  We have had sales staff actually get mad at us for wasting their time, when we were clear from the beginning we did not want a sales presentation and would not buy more points.  Anymore we simply turn down all ""update"" offers, which is unfortunate as we would like to be able to simply get updates about new resorts, how best to use points, special offers etc.  It has also caused us to be cautious when referring people to time share ownership.

I am extremely Happy,"I am extremely Happy, over joyed that we did not buy points from Diamond Resort. A year ago we purchased a Sampler from Diamond Resort Hawaii at the Point at Poipu in Kauai. It cost us over $4000. The sales person told us that we could use almost two weeks at the Point at Poipu. When we called the Las Vegas Sampler person they said that we could not use the sampler at the point of Poipu. That sales person lied to us! We did use the points. We used them to go to the Kauai Shores Hotel on Kauai from Oct 13th 2019 through October 18th and the Royal Lahaina Resort on Maui from October 18th 2019 through the 24th. At each stay we were required to attend an Presentation. Our first presentation was at the Point of Poipu at October 15th 8:30 am. We told the sales person that we were not interested in buying points and that we have had many other presentations. This sales person was very  pleasant and taked to us about 45 minutes and let us go. Our second presentation was at the Kaanapali Beach Club in Maui. Our presentation was scheduled for October 20th at 8:00am. When we arrived we were told that the presentation would not start until 8:30am. We waited around and then a sales person came by and started with the sales talk. We had to watch a movie about Hawaii Diamond Resorts which lasted over ¬Ω hour and also a sales person talked to a group of us in the theater room. Then the sales person took us around the resort and showed us a room. We were not impressed at all. The room had soiled carpet and was not appealing at all.  Then the sales talk continued . When we declined the purchase of points the big guns came out.

The whole presentation lasted over 3 hours with a lot of lying high pressure sales!When we left the presentation we have decided that it would be the last Diamond Resort Time Share Presentation we would attend.

Disappointed,Disappointed. We tried to book a cruise using embark through Diamond as our agent.  The process was extremely tedious and totally unsuccessful. There was absolutely no advantage as the cost of the cruise including being able to use our points was calculated as  more expensive than the advertised price of the cruise. It took two days to get their answer. I would not recommend this process to anyone. While the personnel were pleasant enough the original agent had little knowledge of the process at Diamond for luxury cruises. He simply fumbled along before we finally got to a more senior agent who at least understood more of what we were asking. He did not know the whole process either and had to wait to determine any benefit for us using Diamond. Overall an extremely frustrating experience. We have invested a great deal of money to purchase points and subsequently pay a lot of money annually to maintain these points.

not fun at all.....,"I wish I could give no stars but I guess one star will do. This review is not for the actual resorts but for the process for the timeshares for this company. So my friend and I were staying at a different location and we were offered two food vouchers and a gift card if we went on a tour of a resort. Ok we thought, that's doable. So we planned the next day with getting up early, taking the shuttle, we agreed to 2 hours at this presentation then after we were going to Magic Kingdom. Mind you, this was my first time in Florida and my mind set was spending time in Disney.The next day, we get up, take the shuttle and get to this resort. We waited 15 minutes for a representative. I will not mention any names of people or resorts. So we all started talking and all that, then we took a tour, ok yeah great. It was a nice resort, the person we dealt with was really nice, but...everyone was a little pushy. I hate to say it but life isn't about taking vacations every weekend. I only vacation once in a while because I don't need to vacation all the time. People have responsibilities and bills. I like to vacation to but does that mean I want a timeshare? No. So we kept getting passed around to other people. Mind you, my friend got really uncomfortable over some of the things the representative had said to us. Not cool. We don't need to be talking about sex on a tour. Thanks, but no thanks. Not professional by any means. This tour was said to be two hours max,  we got there at 8am, we left at 12. We lost out on 2 hours at Magic Kingdom.  Then when we were all said and done, after declining all these offers, that were never ending, we were told the shuttles were done for the day. A father with his family made the desk call for a shuttle. I was not paying for an Uber and they made it clear they weren't paying either. So we got our gift card and waited 20 minutes for a shuttle. We could not wait to get the hell off of that property. That whole experience made us feel like crap..yes crap! Never again will we do that.  Not worth the free gifts at all! We made sure to get rid of the free gifts as quickly as possible. I do not recommend these presentations. Yeah it started out ok..but then it turned bad quickly. If someone turns down an offer and they keep telling you no, then the answer will always be no.

I bought Diamond Resorts and timeshare in general so we could have a kitchen and cook for ourselves, just 'live' somewhere while we vacation.  That makes taking trips more economical.  All-Inclusive resorts are very expensive; honestly who can eat and drink $100 of  stuff on a daily basis for a week.  For a couple that is $1400 of expense.

Worst experience ever,"Worst experience ever! After this we will be selling our timeshares and finding a company that cares about their guest safety and well being.Tonight my wife is alone there with our 2 children (5, and 3). My wife and I both have high anxiety and ptsd from multiple deployments in red areas. While she was sleeping she heard the door making noise. She thinks oh someone‚Äôs kids probably just messing around, but then she hears the door open. Mind you my children are sleeping right there. Luckily my wife quickly rushed to the door (and luckily for them she decided not to be armed while on vacation). A family comes walking right in. She immediately confronts them and stops them there to ensure our children's safety. Called down to the front, the lady at the front counter said ‚Äúno need to worry it‚Äôs just a mild inconvenience‚Äù. Is she serious? So if I were to walk into her house in the middle of the night she‚Äôd fell that as a mild inconvenience? My wife requested new card keys. She tried staying optimistic as the front counter lady tried reassuring her it would never occur again and that they are extremely sorry. Ok so now my wife is on end and can‚Äôt even sit down trying to stay on the phone with me in shock of what just happened. Debating on saying screw this whole vacation as she now feels as we are in an unsafe location and fear for our children. I was able to calm her down and try and get through the night until I arrive tomorrow and we will decide what we want to do.30 minutes go by and noise at the door again. Another family walks in! This time my wife spoke to a manager Shawn. Same bs, he said it wont happen again, yet hmm history seems to repeat itself here. He offered a 4 night stay but we will not be accepting at all for we are selling this timeshare and informing every media outlet, and review page. He then said since we wont stay he can offer a $50 credit to shipwreck sally. My wife said whatever to get off the phone before she flipped out on him. We will not be accepting a bs $50 credit. He had the audacity to price the safety of my wife and children with a $50 bs credit? Is he serious? A 4 night stay then a $50 credit, that‚Äôs all my family is worth to this POS? What if it were his family? My wife asked for an internal lock however he said we couldn‚Äôt have one. She doesn‚Äôt feel safe and will now be staying up the entire night setting guard at the door. Our vacation is now doomed in fear of individuals in our timeshare. What if we went to the pool and had our valuables there? What if my wife was in the nude? What if she was sleeping with her meds, and someone hurt or took our children? What if someone hurt my wife? No one seems to care because it didn‚Äôt happen to them. What if I broke into Shawns house twice tonight? Would $50 suffice? His family (which I doubt he has since he could care less about family) would be traumatized. So we finally get a vacation and we have to have one of us on guard setting watch 24 hours. Great vacation?

Timo's is a good setting with a lot of potential however quality of prepared food was disappointing the last two visits so we don't go any more. Our last visit to Timos service was rushed.

The only way I can get mid-week reservations at the Whistler resort now is to book a full week 11 months in advance and then later drop off the pricey weekend portion.  This is an obvious benefit for some poor working stiff to grab a weekend.  So in all fairness one would expect them to have to pay to extra fee, not the member who made this  possible.  But this is too much to ask for, I suppose.   I think one might at least expect to be able to do this for one charge instead of 3, as we were previously able to do.

Second Time Around,"This was our second visit to Diamond Resort's Modern Honolulu. For the most part we enjoyed our stay, however we were disappointed with the lack of upgrades the resort was supposed to under go. We were here in January and were alerted the resort was under going renovations, and on this trip it appeared nothing was renovated. Additionally, we were promised an early check in, and were told nothing was available yet. We arrived at 1230 hours and left to eat and returned at 2:30 and nothing was still available.  We waited until 3:00 pm and were finally told we could check in. We initially had room on the 17th floor and it was changed to the 10th floor. A female clerk initially checked us in and quickly took our resort fees, but told us to wait. Upon returning at 230 pm, I spoke to the same female clerk and after telling her I've never had to wait this long for a check in as a Diamond member, she proceeded to sarcastically explain the cleaning crew was hurrying as fast as they could because of all the late check outs. She then asked if I wanted to change rooms, but she recommended we wait because the room on the 17th floor was worth waiting for. When I received the call at 3 pm, a male attendant gave us our room keys, but this was a different room. This resort needs to take lessons from the Cancun Resort in Las Vegas. The Modern should also limit late checkouts to Silver and above members only. After these encumbrances, the remainder of stay was fine.

From my experience, the sales personnel are very disingenuous (which is infuriating when you are spending this much money).

His presentation was a complete misrepresentation of what we were buying, and we found that out on our first vacation with Diamond Resorts. A very long story short, we were informed that we did not have what we believed we had purchased initially. So we spent more money, believing that we finally purchased everything that we wanted. Then, on our second vacation with Diamond Resorts, we were again informed that we still did not have what we believed we had because we did not purchase the geographical collection we were led to believe we had purchased. So again, we had to spend more money. Lastly, on our third vacation, sales personnel again attempted to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù my wife and I by lowering an interest rate on a loan we have with Diamond Resorts.

Our recent purchase,"Our recent purchase, and subsequent cancellation, was due to inaccurate information by the sales person. We had already purchased recently to get to platinum level and still have an outstanding loan. We were told our current finance rate was 19.9% and because we have excellent credit was told we could save over 6% if we refinanced. However we had to make a minimum purchase to do so. Some how 4000 points was the number shown us and we were told we‚Äôd save over $18000 on interest and our payment wouldn‚Äôt go up much. We asked a couple of questions and a manager was brought in, which seems to be the tactic of confusion to get your attention on something else. Long story short? We were there as the first leg of a Diamond Dream Holiday and leaving on the cruise 2 days later. But I had a bad feeling that the info given us wasn‚Äôt correct. I found a computer and logged into our account and found that our current interest rate was 12.9 not 19.9 that the salesman told us. So we were actually increasing our new rate to 13.9. Also the payment wasn‚Äôt close it actually was going up nearly $200 month. Also the only reason we went to the update was because it was presented to us as a meet & greet with other Diamond Dream Holiday travelers that would be on the same cruise with us. The Luau was fun but we met only one couple going on the cruise.

"Disaster in Vail, Colorado","This experience started out being a nightmare. We were told we‚Äôd receive an email the week before our rental date with instructions concerning the house rental. After receiving no such email, I started calling Diamond Resorts. Every time I reached someone they‚Äôd tell me a message had been sent to the Department that handled the rentals and I‚Äôd receive a call within the hour. After 3 days of calling and no communication we were now down to the day of the rental with no info. I called again in desperation and got hold of an agent who took her job seriously. She assured me she would call the department and would keep me on the phone while she made sure this was handled, and that she did.  I was sent an email almost immediately after she took care of business. It‚Äôs a shame that it took 3-4 days and talking to endless agents to finally get one that did her job. We had friends meeting us there and this situation had me so stressed out it just ruined our trip. I received instructions 3 hours before we were to pick up keys to the property. The property met our needs with four bedrooms and 3 bathrooms but was not the quality I expected from Diamond Resorts and definitely not worth the points we had to use. The master bedroom had metal blinds that were bent and broken. While using the washer/dryer, I leaned over the railing to yell downstairs and it was full of dust. The cleaning crew did bathrooms and changed beds but that was all. There were several things in the house that needed attention. All in all it looked like a rental that had been neglected. Not the caliber I expected from Diamond Resorts. It was very embarrassing to have our friends comment on the state of the house and Diamond Resorts.

Staff are 5 Star+ but standards have dropped.,"Many years ago, when we bought into the ‚Äòtimeshare dream‚Äô, we were sold the concept on (a) quality (b) value for money (c) exclusivity...  in other words, the only way that you could stay at a Dimond Resorts ‚Äòresort‚Äô, was by being a member or guest of the system. Fast forward to the present day, and whilst we still pay our annual fees to be members, the ‚Äòexclusivity‚Äô element has been removed, as Diamond Resorts, now operate as a ‚Äòhotelier‚Äô, and allow the general public to book into the accommodation. Now I know that this is already sounding a bit ‚Äòelitist‚Äô or a touch of ‚Äòsnobbery‚Äô creeping in, I get that, but we paid a lot of money, so that two weeks a year, we could be a bit ‚Äòelitist‚Äô, we could break away from our normal lifestyle, and enjoy a family holiday, knowing that the location, and accommodation, were extra special.. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs snobbery, we all like to stay at a ‚Äònice hotel‚Äô.So as a ‚Äòtimeshare owner‚Äô, you get sold into the whole ‚Äòyou own part of this‚Äô mindset, and with ‚Äòownership‚Äô, I believe comes ‚Äòcare‚Äô, you care for the property and the accommodation, as if its your own, you treat it with respect, and you keep it clean and tidy.. trust me on this, you do not get housekeeping everyday, like you would in a hotel, in fact you have your own ‚Äòvacuum cleaner‚Äô in a lot of locations, so that you can do your own housework.Now it seem that ‚Äòdrunken karaoke‚Äô and even, I‚Äôm not going to use the word pervert here as that would be unjustified, but in 2017, we did find that a single man in a connecting unit, was using his mobile phone, to peer into out accommodation, using the gap beneath the connecting door, a situation that was resolved using a bath towel, and I‚Äôm happy to say, that on our return in 2018, we noticed that the issue had been addressed.This review was asked of ‚ÄòDiamond Resorts‚Äô, not a ‚Äòspecific location‚Äô, which makes it slightly harder and I guess, that makes me slightly more biased in my ‚Äòopinion‚Äô,as I‚Äôm sure, you are reading this, as someone looking to book into a ‚Äòhotel‚Äô as opposed to a ‚Äòtimeshare owner‚Äô... on that front, the staff at all the locations we have used, are beyond 5 stars, quite simply, the best of the best and then some, but the standard of the Resorts has dropped, noticeably over the years, that‚Äôs not to say that you will be staying in squalor, far from it, but ripped fabric, broken fridges, electrical sockets not secured to walls, these all seem like issues you would have at a 2 star motel, not an ‚Äòindustry leading organisation‚Äô who‚Äôs goal it is to ensure your complete relaxation whilst on vacation.So I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say here is this, you wont be disappointed staying at one of the resorts, but if you do find issues, report them, ultimately, the resorts have to answer to us, the members when things go wrong, and we have in the past, taken action to ensure things were put right. On the other hand, staying at ‚Äòour‚Äô resorts aren‚Äôt cheap, and we have found ourselves looking at other ‚Äòhotels‚Äô and thinking, for the same money we spend on annual fees, we could be staying somewhere much better.The bottom line here is quite simple (a) are you happy to spend time in a little hotel room, with basic amenities or (b) do you want lots of space, and all the comforts of home.. if (a) then any hotel room in the world, otherwise a ‚ÄòDiamond Resorts‚Äô resort, wont disappoint you.Hope this helps.",US,3,1,"{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.821, 'pos': 0.146, 'compound': 0.9978}",0.9978

AVOID THIS COMPANY!!!,"My wife and I purchased a 3-night vacation package in September 2018. We were told repeatedly by both the sales person and the supervisor that we would stay at a resort property, unless there were no rooms available for our preferred dates/locations. We were also told explicitly that there would be no additional fees besides the $199 purchase price. As an attorney, I actually read the fine print before I signed the contract. I asked about the language stating that we would not stay at a Diamond Resorts owned or affiliated property. The sales person and supervisor both said that language was only included as a disclaimer in case there was no availability at the resorts but that we ""should have no problem"" booking a room at either Powhatan or Greensprings for the dates that we wanted to travel. When I attempted to book our vacation, I was told that our package entitled us to stay at a hotel, not a resort property. We were offered a room in a Best Western. So, instead of allowing us to stay at a resort property (as we were promised), the booking department tried giving us a room at a cheap, crappy hotel. I was then told that we could pay $50 per night to ""upgrade"" to the resort property. At that point, I asked for a refund. However, I was told about about 10 different customer ""service"" representatives that Diamond has a ""no refund"" policy but they would be happy to cancel our package without issuing a refund. That was obviously not a viable solution. After speaking with countless people, someone from the escalation team finally helped us book a room at the resort - which is what we were promised when we purchased the package.We attended the sales presentation in April and described our experience to multiple sales people, managers, and even someone who claimed to be a director of something (although he did not have a business card and would not give us his contact information). All of the Diamond staff members told us that the booking department had made a mistake because the package that we purchased absolutely entitled us to stay at a resort property - not a second/third-rate hotel. One of the managers said that he ""wanted to make it right"" and asked if we would be willing to give Diamond Resorts a second chance. We were obviously skeptical, but he seemed sincere, so we agreed. That night, we purchased another 3-night vacation package from a sales person at the resort (Mona).We asked the sales person at least 10 times if the package entitled us to stay at a resort property, and if we would be charged any additional fees to do so. She told us repeatedly that the purpose of the offer is to solicit our business, so of course we would stay at the resort. She also said that we would not be charged any additional fees to stay at the resort (which is exactly what the first sales person told us).Well, that was obviously not true. When we called Diamond Resorts and attempted to book our trip, we were told by multiple customer ""service"" representatives that our package entitles us to only stay at a hotel, and there would be a $50 or $100 fee per night to stay at a resort instead. Even worse, the representative offered us a room at La Quinta or or another, similar hotel.  Before we purchased the second package, the sales person said that, if there were no rooms available at any of the resorts, we would stay in a hotel of comparable quality to the resorts (she even showed us pictures of some of the hotels, which appeared to be very expensive/luxurious). La Quinta and Best Western are in NO WAY comparable to a Diamond resort or any of the hotel options that the sales person showed us. The sales person also promised to cancel our package and refund the entire purchase price if any problems arose while attempting to book our vacation. She showed us a button on her computer screen that would allow her to cancel and refund our purchase. So, it appears that despite what the customer ""service"" people have repeatedly told us, there is in fact a way for them to cancel and refund our purchase.  When I asked to cancel the package, I received the exact same response as last time: ""We have a no-refund policy; we would be happy to cancel your package but we will not give you a refund.""We were also told that we would have to pay a $200 fee to go to Virginia Beach in August because that is considered ""high season."" Again, the sales person told us that we would be charged NO ADDITIONAL FEES. We told the sales person exactly where (Virginia Beach) and when (August 2019) we want to go on vacation, and she made no mention of the fact that we would have to pay an extra $200 for some ridiculous ""high season"" fee.When we purchased the package, we were also given a ""Getaway Certificate"" as a gift. The sales person said that after finishing the sales presentation during our next stay at a Diamond resort, the gift office would give us an activation code that would allow us to book our next vacation (either five nights for $49 or seven nights for $99). However, according to Wendy Hernandez, Diamond has NO RECORD of this gift and, as a result, the company is not required to honor it. Apparently our file does not say anything about us receiving the ""Getaway Certificate.""

In 2001 we bought into the timeshare‚Ä¶,"In 2001 we bought into the timeshare market through Club Interwest.  We saw this as an opportunity for our family to vacation over the coming years. In Dec 2017 we went to Embarc Palm Desert for the first time.  A few years before that we were at Blue Mtn and heard about the sale of Club Interwest to Diamond, we were concerned. We felt in Dec 2017, that we were STRONGLY PRESSURED into a sale for further points; one of the selling points was that we could use our points to purchase air miles and thereby help reduce our costs of airfare, which would reduce our 'overall' cost of time-sharing (airfare, yearly resort fees etc).  We have found this option to be very difficult and frustrating to sort out AND just recently bought United Air Miles, inquired about buying through this plan and was told I needed 85,000 points for return airfare for myself and husband.  This runs into all sorts of issues, which cost additional funds so much that we can find better fares through Expedia! Initially when Diamond took over the service when we called the service was terrible; the people who answered the phones gave different answers, it was difficult to find someone who could give answers.  This has improved..our biggest concern remains how can we sell our points as none of our children are interested in our points, which was another selling point that we were told, how can we sell these points! Yes we know about the Diamond Resort opportunity to sell, but it has a 20 year waiting list!

They will seize all they can from your pocketbook!,"Diamond Resorts International was poised to remove $14,000 from us and much more in their additional fees. Fortunately, my husband did a check regarding where we had stayed in Kauai, Hawaii, and investigated how many points it would take to stay a week as we had done in the past. This unit in Kauai was one of our two weeks of exchange with Interval International. He noticed it would take all the points offered; plus, charging us $14,000 atop this, and our already owned units and more. Which means they would have also derived some interest in our lock-off unit of two residences, and $14,000, plus all their annual fees, etc. And we read in the contract, they can increase owner fees up to 25 percent whenever they desire.The salespeople had assured us if we turned our lock-off units over to them for 50,000 points, and paid $14,000 atop this, we would gain a great deal. No, we were losing a significant amount of investment. It is unbelievable that people can take such advantage of others with no legal repercussions.Our one unit of two, is worth far more than 50,000 points; more accurately‚Äî140,000 points.

It is simply too expensive in‚Ä¶,"We are 18 year members from Sunterra (bought out by Diamond).VERY Experienced. The people at the resorts are generally wonderful, and most properties are very nice. But that would be true no matter how we booked it. You can almost always find rooms available on HOTELS.COM. It just makes NO FINACIAL SENSE. It is the WORST financial choice you can make.It is simply too expensive in maintenance fees considering we already spent over $35,000 originally (2001-much more expensive now). We have calculated that just the Maint fees average out to $152/night each year. We can get close to those prices by simply booking directly with the properties or similar properties as a hotel. And, the only way to reduce our fees with the new plan being offered is to BUY MORE points at exorbitant rates. As a direct example, Kaanapali Beach Club Maui costs us $1207/week with points, and $1503 booking directly on HOTELS.COM.  Invest $35,000 over 18 years to save $900/year. How is that smart? Plus, it is often impossible to get the resorts you want without booking 10 months ahead.AS a seasoned Diamond veteran,  I advise:- Do not EVER believe what the salesman says. They blatantly lie to get you to sign. Every time. - Do not EVER attend a ""membership update"". They are simply high pressure sales presentations that eat up precious vacation time.- If you do a presentation, tell them you will stand up and leave at 90 minutes and will want your ""gift"" then. AND THEN DO IT!- When booking a resort add in the comments ""NO SALES PRESENTATIONS!"" And then repeat that at the front desk and again at the Diamond Welcome desk (they will always refer you to). A true story:At one resort (Cypress Pointe Resort Orlando Florida Feb 19 2017) the front desk gave our keys to the ""Diamond Guy"" who REFUSED to give us our keys until we talked to him. Then when we told him our British friends were waiting outside, he left us and pressured our friends to come in to the office with us. My wife stomped back to the front desk and (in front of dozens checking in) started screaming that we were being detained against our will and demanded to talk to the manager about pressing charges. That got their attention and we finally got our keys and went to our room.DO NOT BUY!",US,3,1,"{'neg': 0.074, 'neu': 0.808, 'pos': 0.117, 'compound': 0.9677}",0.9677

Bullying is the name of their game...,"My husband and I visit a sales presentation at the Polo Towers in Las Vegas on May 19, 2019.  It was part of a bounce back for staying at the Golden Nugget for $199 for three nights.  The presentation started on such a positive note.  Breakfast, friendly greetings and a very upbeat presentation.  That all changed once we sat down after the presentation and simply asked ""What is the cost?"" We were given a constant run around by our representative. We were asked to fill out a form giving all of our personal information and we refused because there was no cost given.  We were then pushed and bullied into going on a tour even though we insisted on knowing the cost of what was presented.  We finally were told that it would be $35,000 for the vacation plan of 7,500 points to be paid over ten years.  My husband and I were asked what do we think about the value.  I said I see no value and then the intense bullying increased.  The manager or director came over and he said what about giving you an every other year in points program for $16,000.  We said it still equates to no value in our opinion.  We declined and he said we could just leave and pay full price for the hotel at the Golden Nugget.  This request was done in an elevate voice in front of others.  We were appalled beyond at this point.  Then Marissa, the sales director, came over and began to speak with us on other offerings.  She was very pleasant and offered a very affordable package.  My husband and I declined due to the manner in which we were treated by the first two representatives.

Sorry I ever got involved with Diamond Resorts,"We attended a Diamond Event in January in Orlando. We stayed at the Mystic Dunes Resort.  The events were lacking.  The Dinner was supposed to be an awards ceremony for the amateurs.  We were led to believe that some of the celebrities in the tournament would be at this event...None that I saw.  Then we attended the tournament.  Everything there was nicely done except no one told us the 18th green were the lunch and seating were located was a good 500 yards from the club house.  My wife has trouble walking long distances without assistance.  If we had known we would have brought her walker.  We asked if there was a cart to get her back to the clubhouse and were told they were for the players.  The evening event was nice but not what was on the original documentation.  The accommodations were nothing special.  Room was not upgraded.  Looked like something out of the 70s.  And then we went to the sales presentation.  We said not now and they sold us a sampler membership agreement.  The ""hospitality Representative, Randy Siedel, told us if we charge it on our Diamond Credit cards it would be interest free for six months.  Well, this month after the first month we were charged interest.  The Barclay Bank Representative said there is no notation on our account.  Still waiting to here why I am being charged interest since I was told it is interest free for six months.  I have yet to stay in any accommodations that I would recommend to friends.  I booked a vacation in Williamsburg VA this fall.  I requested a first floor when I made the reservation because my wife cannot climb stairs and I know this place has no elevators.

Having just returned from a diamond‚Ä¶sunset bay club Tenerife,"Having just returned from a diamond resorts stay at sunset bay club Tenerife, it was the most horrendous holiday I have ever had.

Diamond Resorts motto is ‚ÄúStay Vacationed‚Äù,"Diamond Resorts motto is ‚ÄúStay Vacationed,‚Äù but they go out of their way to make sure they harass you about attending ‚Äúan owner update‚Äù (not an update at all, but, merely a chance to hard pressure sell you more points) weeks before you even leave your home to start your vacation. Again, more pressure when you check in. And yet, more pressure calls to your room, later, if you decline at check in. Vacations are to escape the harassments of life, aren‚Äôt they? You would think they would appreciate & honor their members in good standing, and just let them be, sadly, they do not, they harass you just like they would any other non-DRI member, they hope to snag into purchasing more points.

I can stay in a 2 bedroom condo for the price of a hotel room most places. They are clean & immaculate inside and out. The condos have everything you need. The kitchens are fully equipped with plates cups glasses flatware and every single pot and pan and utensil you can ever need. They have top-of-the-line toasters coffee makers blenders Etc. Each condo I've stayed in ihad ts own washer and dryer. They give you dish soap laundry soap paper towels Etc. Their beds and linens are top-of-the-line and like sleeping in heaven. Three of the four places I've stayed had huge bathtubs in the master bathroom. Plenty of bath towels pool towels blankets pillows and extra linens are always provided. I've never had a problem with parking. There are always activities planned around the clock for kids and family members. If you forgot something from home more than likely they have it. If you need anything you just call the front desk and someone will be at your door right away. Now when I plan little mini vacations I always make sure I visit locations where there is a Diamond Resort. I usually booked through Groupon or Expedia for the best prices. The places I have stayed are Cypress Pointe, Liki Tiki, Mystic Dunes(all 3 in Orlando) and The Cove on Ormond Beach. I love all of them.

Diamond = extremely high pressure sale tactics,"Chaos! Diamond uses high pressure sales, scare tactics and empty promises to coerce and/or contract a purchase. We have visited the same TN resort every May of our anniversary, for 26 years. This particular resort is our absolute favorite. We got married in Pigeon Forge and will continue to stay there. However, our opinion on Diamond as a company, is less than favorable. The new rules or policy with Diamond is requiring us to attend a ""sales"" presentation, regardless of our ownership status each time we book a reservation there. We have owned since 1997. So, last May after sitting for 5 hours and stating continuously, ""we're not purchasing that"" they tag teamed several sales associates in an attempt to twist our arms to purchase. After we declined the high priced sale offered, they offered (and we decided to try) a ""sampler"" package that came with several promises to provide a cruise and an opportunity to get out of this timeshare after the sampler ends in 2020. The sampler package allows us a ""try me"" points to use where and whenever, but as we were unaware and was not explained, we would have to attend presentations among other restrictions. Well, we weren't handed that cruise that was promised, but we weren't giving up that easy. We had asked for it during the numerous times when checking in during our many stays there throughout the year. Each time we were only to be promised they would provide it at the end of each stay. No cruise certificate ever surfaced, until this past week. May 2019, we had booked our annual anniversary trip using that purchased ""sampler"" package acquired only 1 year ago. When the Diamond representative from Las Vegas had to get approval and call us back for us to be placed in a hotel and not the resort, I canceled the reservation. When she did not return my call and confirm my cancellation, I called them again. I spoke with another Diamond representative and he assured me that it would be canceled and that he could get the dates that we asked for. I asked him to check on it. But, he took that as a booking request. After numerous emails to my husband and me, we thought they canceled the reservations and then I took it upon myself to book it directly through the resort. Apparently, you have to cancel the reservation(s) with the exact representative who scheduled it since they are commission based. After we arrived at our resort, it was discovered that there were TWO reservations for the same weekend at various hotels, not including our resort that I booked directly. I was then able to cancel all of them except the resort I booked, with the help of the Diamond concierge. At that time, we complained that we weren't able to get the Saturday stay we asked for to end our trip and we still didn't get our promised cruise. She assured us that we would this time and then proceeded to offer us a gifted Saturday's night's stay. We graciously accepted after she told us that we wouldn't even need to change rooms. Unfortunately, we were unable to use the free night's stay due to the time spent at the sales center explaining that we STILL do not want to buy. I asked if in the last year that they had renovated any other rooms than the one they continuously show to unsuspecting newcomers (we could see it from our balcony). He then stated that this resort would NOT be upgraded or improved for a very long time. Which tells us that the resort will continue to deteriorate until then. So, after another high pressured, scare tactic, 1.5 hours of wasted time, we finally received our cruise certificate and headed to our room where we planned to relax and watch it rain from our balcony for the rest of the day. However, when my husband and I returned to the room, we received a knock on the door by the cleaning personnel. We told her that we were staying another night and she appeared to be confused. Next we received a text message from a sales associate at the sales center who introduced himself and asked if there's anything he can do to make us feel better and that he saw us leave and we appeared to be very upset (which we weren't). I told him that we hadn't met and he confirmed but wanted to speak with us. I graciously declined after another knock on the door. This time it was a man and he told us that we have to move rooms since that room was already taken. My husband said he would call the front desk to verify that. Sure enough, they said they had been trying to reach us to get checked into another room but was unable to locate us (we were scheduled in the sales center for 8:30AM!). After I pulled my wet clothes from the washer and we had already loaded the car, we decided that enough was enough and we proceeded to just check out and go home.",US,2,0,"{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.859, 'pos': 0.088, 'compound': 0.9881}",0.9881

It is our fault that we didn't do due diligence on our part and did not read the fine print.  Some of their sales pitch however, was an outright lie.  Our 21 year old daughter was with us and they said she could use the points from our sampler; well she can't.  We as owners, need to be there because with each trip we have to attend the dreaded one hour sales pitch.  Long story short, we have resolved ourselves to follow their contract and will use the points if we can.  We have reserved a week in Scottsdale and have reserved our one hour presentation per the contract.  Well a good friend has passed away and I must attend the funeral which conflicts with the presentation time.  I called in to change the date and time of our presentation and they said they were completely booked for the time we were there.

"Love the Lodging Options - Hate the ""Updates""","First, I have not stayed at a ""bad"" Diamond Resort property.  I do not regret the number of points we have or the maintenance fees for using them for lodging.  We do not use the points for anything else but lodging.  I have no intention of purchasing more points.  Done.  Kids don't want to deal with them; therefore, when we are gone they will be turned back to the resort.  Until then, I will enjoy them and got to places I would not have done without them.  The extreme negative resulting in two stars is their idea of an ""Owner's Update"".  I have stopped going to them no matter what funny money options they throw at me and I have told any guests not to go through the events.  If they need the money that bad to do something (dinner, train ride, tour, etc.) let me know and I will get them a gift card.  The friendship is worth more than listening to the horror stories of their experience.  I know more about the properties and options than the person doing the update because their sole purpose is not to provide an update but to sell more points.    Our key is that we do not use the points for anything but lodging and no plans to.  Therefore telling me all the things I can do with more points falls on deaf ears.

Very Mixed feelings,"We bought entry level points in Maui in 2012. They gave us the grand tour of the best accommodations Kaanapali and were very fast to take our money. The sales guy even went as far as suggesting that we should use Interval trade off to get better and cheaper vacation options. In 2015 we made the mistake of going for an event update in Maui. We were sucked into buying more points. Again Diamond were very fast to take our money. December 2017 we got sucked into another lifetime event in St Maarten and yes we bought more were convinced to transfer of Hawaiian point to the US collection we were granted temporary Gold status for 12 months (expiring December 2018). September 2018 we got sucked into another life time event in Kauai and we were convinced that we needed to transfer our points back into the Hawaiian collection. December 2018 in Orlando, we expressed our outrage during a life time event to no avail. But in good faith we entered into an arrangement that would help get us to Gold status (3500 points) by way of a sampler package. Come December 2018 our temporary Gold status (granted in December 2017) expired. To my surprise in February 2019 I received a letter DATED NOVEMBER 2018 congratulating me on my Gold Status. I have made many calls to many people and sent many emails to many people trying to validate the temporary Gold status. All I get is we are going to look into it and get back to you. In April 2019 while in Maui I requested a face to face meeting with the highest ranking Diamond official to see if I could resolve the temporary gold status issue. They referred me back to the people in Kauai suggesting that they would be best suited to resolve the issue. As of today May 10, 2019 over 3 months later I still have no answers and my portfolio still shows me as Silver. Here is what upsets me. Diamond are very fast to take your money and to charge you fees and late penalties and interest  but as an owner I have NO LEVERAGE to get results. So here are the mixed feelings. We like the vacation part, we like Maui and will enjoy traveling more in the future BUT we feel like once Diamond have your money they forget who you are and really don't care.

Nice hot water & communal coffee machine.However, if you don't have a car, the fact that you can't enter before 3.30pm and can't store luggage before check in or after check out is disappointing and very inconvenient, especially if it's raining.The pillows were terrible- thin polyester filling which didn't support head. There were no cushions to support back while watching TV. The pillows were supposed to do that, yet because there was a gap between the wall, used as a bed head and the mattress, the thin pillows could slip through the gap and they didn't support the back.Also, the hairdryer plug was broken, so it was unuseable. There is no refrigerator or microwave either and while the room states it is sound proofed, it is not.

"Nice, Comfortable, Clean","This was a pleasant place to stay and we would not hesitate to stay here again. It is a modest house with small comfortable rooms, which seemed to be recently renovated. There is no signage anywhere, nor is there a front desk with anyone to talk to. You get an email the day before with the digital code to unlock the front and room doors and you just let yourself in. If you have any issues, you have to text message them - which we had to do a few times. Jade (not sure if she was an owner, a manager, or service staff) was very friendly and responsive. The bed was very comfortable. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean. The air conditioner and ceiling fan kept the room temperature comfortable.  The location of Domum was perfect -  a few blocks walk to the Strand and a 3 min Uber ride to the cruise port. The only reason it has 4 stars and not 5 is because of it‚Äôs minimalistic character.

If you value comfort or having any‚Ä¶,"If you value comfort or having any space at all, stay somewhere else. The room was tiny which was made worse by the way they had it laid out. There‚Äôs no mini fridge and only one tiny trash can. In the bathroom there is no counter so if you have hair utensils or anything else you have to set them in the sink while you use them. The water takes forever to get warm. The bed is hard and uncomfortable, the pillows are lumpy and have no substance so you‚Äôre constantly trying to refluff it. There‚Äôs only one mirror and it‚Äôs above the sink in the bathroom, so no way to see below your neck. Housekeeping turns your air up when they clean. We had it set to 61 because we need it cold to sleep. Came in to nap after having been gone a few hours and they had cranked it up to 68 and turned the fans off. This happened twice. The door to the bathroom is glass, so if you need to use it in the middle of the night, it will light up the entire room. There‚Äôs no ledge in the shower so if you‚Äôre trying to shave good luck. The doors are extremely heavy and don‚Äôt stay open, so coming in or out with luggage is a hassle. The sheets are scratchy and made of a super loud material, every time one of us turned it sounded like someone was crinkling a newspaper. If you‚Äôre a single person just looking for a shower and a clean bed it‚Äôs perfect. If you‚Äôre not traveling alone and have so much as one bag, you‚Äôll likely feel cramped and irritated at the lack of storage or any other space.UPDATE: Below is owners response Reply from Domum de Venc√©Greetings, as advertised: ‚ÄúDomum is a minimum space/lightly furnished boutique‚Äù. The rooms are modeled after European dimensions; recently rebuilt and regularly updated, everything is bespoke, from Phylrich bathroom fixtures to Ann Sacks floor tiles. For larger accommodation we recommend our Deluxe options.I tried to copy and paste the text on the website I used to book but it won‚Äôt allow me to and this site won‚Äôt let me attach. So to the owner of the hotel: go check your business description on Booking.com. No where on there does it say anything you just described. If you‚Äôre going to use different sites to book, you should make sure they all say what you think they say.UPDATE:I appreciate you changing your reply after realizing that your description was not as you thought, however, there was only one picture of our room which showed the bed and a hallway and one picture of the bathroom. The description of the hotel said every room had a seating area so I assumed that somewhere off the hallway pictured was the seating area. But the hall just went back to the door and bathroom. So you can say now that the room is as ‚Äúpictorially described‚Äù but when I booked, your description said seating area, so despite your pictures, there should have been a seating area. Most hotels don‚Äôt shoot every angle of every room so I wasn‚Äôt concerned not actually seeing the seating area. I‚Äôll know better next time I book a hotel somewhere.",US,1,0,"{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.899, 'pos': 0.06, 'compound': 0.8908}",0.8908

Historically Modern | Minimal Space,"On their website they say""A Beautiful Space To DreamHistorically Modern | Minimal SpaceAn intelligent rendition of 19th century elegance infused with modern comfort.  Domum offers thoughtful beauty in minimum / lightly furnished space for guests seeking a spot of luxury with their morning coffee.  Guest rooms are complemented with ten-foot ceilings that accent this home's historic origin.  Original wood floors that, although revived, reflect a charm earned through decades of experience. En suite personal bathing rooms are reminiscent of the Mediterranean, both fresh and tranquil.  Your room is coated with juxtaposed color that's both subtle and bold; a rich expression that is sure to delight.""The key phrase is ""minimum/lightly furnished space""This is an historic property turned hotel, but really more like a B&B but there is no breakfast. I really liked the 19th century feel of the property. The location is quiet and perfect for the strand area of Galveston.Inside the property it is quite modern. Before I give you the negative side of things, I would stay here again. My intention is not for you to not consider the property, but to better understand what you are getting. I stayed in a single room with a queen bed. I knew the space would be small but didn't really care at the time because I was just planning to sleep. There was a bed, desk, chair, and a coat rack (plus the bathroom of course). There was no closet, no shelf, no place to put you suitcase, no mini-fridge, no ice on the property, and no vending machine. So if you wanted a cold drink, you would have to head out to a store. I didn't realize how important it was for me to have ice or access to a cool drink if for no other reason than to take my medicine. It was very inconvenient to have to place the suitcase on the floor. The description they provide is very accurate. The pictures of the rooms are accurate.There is no front desk. You are emailed a code that gives you access to the front door and your room door. If you are technology impaired you might find this difficult. I personally had some difficlty because it is not very clear that you have entered the code correctly. The place is not ADA compliant and probably is exempted due to it's historic nature. I only say that because if you use a wheel chair or walker I would not recommend this property as there in no sidewalk, an uneven cobblestone walkway from the fence to the house, and steps to the front porch. And more stairs if you are on the second floor. In my single room I don't think you would be able to turn a wheelchair around in the room and a walker would take up sprecious space. There is no onsite parking. It is street parking and there is a sign on the street that says 2hr parking 8:00am-5:00pm with exemption for resident pass. Fortunately when I entered the room there was a parking plackard for the car. If you have children the small room is not for you. If you are a couple, the small room will be a bit cramped. I don't know about the other rooms. Even with that, overall it was a pleasant stay",US,4,2,"{'neg': 0.075, 'neu': 0.836, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': 0.3547}",0.3547

OK property a little disappointing.,"This small property was very well kept and updated especially for its age. Keeping to a European type hotel was good advise since I was not expecting lots of ""frills"", in which there were none. 1. The sheets/blankets seemed very nice and clean until I found numerous pubic hairs. I am sure (and hoped) they were from the washer or dryer during cleaning, since everything looked and smelled clean, but still disturbing.2. The air conditioner above the bathroom was leaking water excessively. The floor outside of the bathroom and inside was especially pooling water. Housekeeping should have noticed this previously and advised management. It was there when I checked in so not a ""new"" problem but I had to step over, or in, water consistently.3. Nice to have Netflix and other stations like that but I get those on my cable at home. Would have liked some local channels for news/weather etc.also.4. I am a career property management professional, not a ""picky"" consumer. If this was one of my properties that I inspected, the manager would have to do some ""splainin"" to do (to quote Ricky Ricardo).Have stayed in many hotels in Galveston over the years and this was not the worse.

Cheaper than some but we definitely found out why.,"The pictures made it seem like a much larger room but it was basically a closet with a bathroom in it. We did not get housekeeping, we tried to ask about it and they just said they would get it the next day. When we arrived there were spiders crawling on the ceiling. There was mold on the shower curtain. When we finally did get housekeeping, 2 days into our stay, they didn‚Äôt sweep the sand off of the, maybe, 3 square foot area where we could walk so it was impossible to not track it into the bed. They talk about the complementary  WiFi but it hardly worked either, not that we needed it a lot but trying to wind down with a show after being in the sun all day was what we were trying to do. The ac did not work well either so the room stayed muggy and somewhat warm. There was no signage when you pull up so we had to approach the house to be sure the number was correct according to the address. Seemed odd for a place that calls itself a hotel.

Hip Charm in Galveston‚Äôs East End,"Loved the place! And a preserved 1886 home with wonderfully hip public areas and rooms!  I stayed Domum for a single night and was in town for business.

(TV worked once in the early evening on then day I checked in but would not work for me on thereafter. But then, WHO goes to beautiful Galveston to stay in the room to watch TV anyway?!) Other than that, the room was all that I had hoped, Beautifully appointed with the latest beds, linens, toiletries, black out curtains, with absolutely exceptional bathroom facilities! Beautifully functioning air-conditioning.  The bed was pure bliss and absolute heaven, with fluffy pillows and wonderful linens.  Extremely accommodating staff, made allowances for my inability to download the app that would allow me to bypass the magnetic locks on the exterior doors and my room door: Provided me with a physical key to allow me to enter my room! (Thank you!) And provided a free parking pass for me to park my vehicle in the permit-only residential neighborhood.

The Difference is in the Details,"It‚Äôs been a long and difficult 18 months dealing with Covid. From being quarantined to missing family and friends, I was exhausted from the whole routine of living like a hermit. So when the opportunity arose to visit Peru and Machu Picchu I jumped at the opportunity. Of course because of the continuing health crisis I knew the only way I could have the experience I needed and deserved was to use a top notch travel agency group. So when I found ExploreInca it was like winning the lottery!  They handled everything, from the day to day schedule, hotels (which were 1st class), meals, etc. But one of the biggest üëçüèª I can give is the safety measures for Covid 19. They followed all the protocols but did it in a way that it was never a hassle. They made sure we had any and all documentation we needed and if anything did come up we made one quick phone call to Patricia (The one you should talk to!) and BOOM! Problem solved. I loved the way the itinerary was set up with a healthy mix of scheduled events and free time. I have to give a shout out to Manuel, our day to day tour leader,  he is a 3rd generation tour leader and you can feel his passion for the craft as he explained different things. His culture and its history are important to him which just gives the whole experience more juice!  To sum it all up please see my title as Patrica, Manuel, and everyone at ExploreInca left nothing to chance thus ensuring the amazing experience my family and I had!You can‚Äôt go wrong with ExploreInca!",US,5,2,"{'neg': 0.053, 'neu': 0.784, 'pos': 0.163, 'compound': 0.9886}",0.9886
An exceptional experience....,"I cannot speak highly enough of Miluska and Explore Inca.  We just didn't have an excellent experience, we had an exceptional experience.  The excursions, the properties and guides exceeded our expectations. I would like to make a special mention of two guides in particular;  Juan ""Manny"" Manuel Yanez was one of the best guides I have ever experienced as well as Ruth Silvera Raymondi Khadidja.  (For those reading this review I'm a seasoned traveler - 25 countries, 4 million miles) Visiting the village at Huilloc watching how the local villagers made beautiful textiles and their weaving methods was a highlight of the trip. This fun adventure was followed by a horse ride at Wayra Ranch through the back streets of Sacred Valley.  I love that property!! (Sol y Luna)  The next day we thoroughly enjoyed Manny guiding us through Ollantaytamia and the ancestral grounds of the Inca's.  His extensive knowledge made this site incredibly educational.  Our guide at Machu Picchu was also so knowledgeable he kept us very engaged the entire time.  The next day we enjoyed a 1/2 day Cusco tour going through the markets and streets of Cusco. The JW Marriott was a perfect location and a beautiful property.   Finally ending our vacation back in Lima where Ruth held our hand through COVID testing at the airport and then a fantastic excursion through Lima. The highlight was watching Ruth and my nephew Salsa Dancing with the crowd on a Saturday night!!! A perfect ending to a fantastic vacation thanks to Exploreinca!  P.S. Thank you Miluska for the pdf file on Lima and Cusco restaurants - UNREAL!!! I didn't realize Peru had become the gastro capital of the world.  Central was an excellent recommendation.

I am seriously thinking of cancelling my Amex Platinum card not only because across the board, Amex hotel rates are consistently higher for luxury hotels compared to Five Star Alliance rates but also because, the perks offered by Amex, are of lesser value than ones included in the 5 Star Signature package with Five Star Alliance.

Wonderful service,"I have always been looking for a luxury hotel/travel service; and Five Star Alliance is definitely the answer to my quest. Upon my booking, a Five Star Alliance staff called me to confirm my booking - she also offered me a ""Signature Travel"" package. The package includes a room upgrade upon check-in, plus a $65 voucher to food and drinks during my stay. She helped me cancelled my original booking and spoke with the hotel to upgrade me to the ""Signature Travel"" package. She was friendly, efficient and helpful. When I arrived at the hotel, I was offered the upgrade, as they promised. What pleasantly surprised me was that the upgrade was to a ""Privilege suite"" (Sofitel, Kurfurstendamm, Berlin) - the suite was simply amazing. I stayed in the suite for two nights and it was one of the best hotel experience I ever had. I also took advantage of the $65 voucher and dinned at the hotel restaurant (one of the best French restaurants in Berlin), which was also amazing.Overall, I will definitely use Five Star Alliance for my next travel.

The drinks were incredible, ordered their Royal Pine, have your camera ready the drink is inside a frozen pineapple. Their signature drink. When in Rome... OMG.

Fantastic experience and I would argue‚Ä¶,"Fantastic experience and I would argue the best value in South Beach. We booked the day pass for my family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children).

Food and beverage options were very good and service was attentive and friendly. The grounds were beautiful and the lobby was a nice sanctuary during the heat of the day. A couple of tips: if you want shade, grab a seat on the south side of the pool. The north side is perfect for direct sunlight. There is a public parking garage about two blocks away on 16th. That was $20 for a full day $10 for less than 6 hours. Great location for doing dinner on Espanola Way after a day at the pool. Check out the activity schedule, yoga and games are available/included.

Big disappointment,"First off, I want to say that I've on the Big Island for over a decade.We have a five year old boy so we thought that we'd check out the famous slides at the Hilton Waikoloa resort.The set-up at the two slide locations is challenging because there aren't enough chairs for everyone. You are then forced to purchase overpriced cabana tents if you do not want to bake in the sun. And the areas around the slides can get pretty dirty since there is landscaping and dirt nearby. The food options are atrocious especially if you do not want to die of a heart attack. And of course, the options are grossly overpriced. I feel badly for folks who come here from around the country, have this kind of experience and leave thinking that this is Hawaii.Since moving here, I've been aware that while living in Hawaii that there are clearly two different experiences: the residential and the tourist.

A perfect day ruined ‚Ä¶,"It was a gorgeous day and we were celebrating 20 years together, we were thrilled to celebrate at the Islander resort for a mini vacation on the last weekend of our holiday vacation. It was a perfect morning with our 3 kids and parents. We socialized with a family of newly weds from Ohio, and various kids from other places. It was the makings of a lifelong memory. Everything was going spectacularly until a group of 5-6 individuals arrived to the pool area‚Ä¶ loudly and boisterously going to the bar and ordering drinks, and later settling in an area by the entrance and in the pool. The individuals were speaking in Spanish (which happens to be our first language) in profanities and altering the atmosphere of the pool. Slowly but surely, families started leaving. Discretely, but in retrospect, they were listening to their instincts. Our two older children no longer wanted to stay in the pool, noticing all of the school-aged children had evacuated, and they went to play ping-pong and soccer with their father and grandmother. I stayed with my 2 yo, swimming in the shallow end. A young mother arrived with her 2 yo and our toddlers quickly started bonding. They excitedly exchanged names in toddler speak but the 4 men that were in the pool picked up on those names and started calling the little girls by their names. They called my daughter‚Äôs name and she trustingly started to swim their way. I quickly yanked her back but the other mom was visibly uncomfortable and pulled her child away and left. Seeing that we were the only ones left in the pool with these men, I pulled my little one out and went to find the rest of my family. We had a great time at the ping pong table and soccer area, but then I headed back with all of the children and their grandmother. My son jumped into the pool when my daughter and husband went to the cafe for more food. By that time my 2 yo had fallen asleep in my arms, so I sat on a chair by the pool. At that time, the men in the pool started taunting my son, asking him where he was from, laughing, and loudly making unwelcome comments. My mother pulled my 6 yo boy out of the pool and when my my husband came back I mentioned that the atmosphere in the pool had drastically changed. I mentioned the incidents and my husband went to request that they refrain from taunting our children. An altercation ensued. They screamed to my mother that if we didn‚Äôt want our children harassed we should not take them out in public. I called 911 because the screaming was getting heated and it was getting physical. The individuals were asked to leave as the police arrived. They were in the resort, without resort passes, were not hotel guests or customers and there were no consequences. The police that arrived interviewed my son and it was acknowledged that they were in the wrong for harassing a minor, while trespassing, and they had moment prior been bragging about being high and intoxicated. Apparently, a woman had paid for one resort pass and let them all in. The resort staff came and tried to smooth out ruffled feathers, but Stuart, the manager promised to rectify the situation. However, we waited, afraid of retaliation by the individuals, and were not helped or reassured further by the resort staff. After paying hundreds of dollars for the resort passes, and hundreds of dollars for lunch, we expected the ambiance to be a little more family friendly and decent. We are extremely disappointed and will be sharing our experiences on multiple online venues. The way the situation was dealt with was subpar and the service should have been directed towards the patrons, not the rifraff that came ashore. I gave the resort 2 stars only because it was so clean and pristine, otherwise I would have given it less stars.",US,2,0,"{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.867, 'pos': 0.073, 'compound': 0.8168}",0.8168

We said that really wasn't fair to us since we had paid $150 for the cabana for the day. He apologized & said they forgot to block the schedule since this was all new to them. He was nice about it but this was not the experience we were looking for so it cut our afternoon very short & definitely not worth the money paid by us.

"Worth it, with some caveats","The main pool is beautiful, and there are two more from which to choose.  The main pool is just outside the lobby/lounge and features upbeat music (mostly 80‚Äôs) and a cantina.  The hot tub continues to be warm, not hot, as mentioned in earlier reviews this summer.  The hot tub at the nearby pool was  green and taped off.  However, the nearby pool was quiet (no music and no people) and features a very shallow kiddie wading pool.The cantina is at the main pool (open 12 to 5 or 6, I believe) and the food is not inexpensive.  But it is reasonable.  The food was good, but the fries were barely warm by the time they came from the main restaurant.  The facilities were very clean!  Every time I visited them, staff was cleaning and re-stocking.One sink wasn‚Äôt working and the staff apologized. The only problem was that the restrooms were up a flight of stairs.  Even the staff at the cantina has to make that long trek to the restrooms.  The pool is long and on the narrow side and so the walk can be long.  It isn‚Äôt a big deal if you are younger, but older people might find it onerous, and also families with young children might find it takes a while for a restroom break. I also want mention the third pool over at the tower.  It is a short hike‚Äî10 to 15 minutes.  But, the hot tub is hot!  The pool is smaller and older, but sort of elegant.  There are a few shaded cabana type areas.  I think there might be an additional gym there.Wanted to mention the nice touch of offering the free s‚Äômore kits.  We really enjoyed that.  They give away the kits in the late afternoon where the towels and water are.  They include sticks and have two fire tables available.Lastly, the parking validation didn‚Äôt go 100% smoothly for us.  If you are a given a plastic key card for the parking validation, stick that plastic key card in the machine.  (This is not the same thing as the plastic pool key card).  Do not scan your parking slip that you got when you entered.  Fortunately, a parking attendant materialized when we were stuck there for a minute.  However, you may be given a different type of parking validation.  Make sure you get clear directions and pay better attention than I did.  It was the price.  We had a great time.

Based on my experience,"Based on my experience, I would rate Resort Pass as a premiere booking site.  Their customer service actually lives up to its name:  ""customer.  service.""  In my personal experience, they have gone out of their way to accommodate me & my requests.  The only 'complaint' that I have has nothing to do with them as an independent company.  My complaint is has to do with the hotels & facilities that contract with them for their services.  Through no fault of Resort Pass, many hotels et al fail to deliver on the services/products that they advertise via Resort Pass.  For example, many facilities fail to inform RP (Resort Pass) of their specific policies, restrictions, black out dates and the like.  So while many of us complain to RP about a hotel stating that they have availabilities on a given date only to find that upon attempting to book, the afore-mentioned facilities are ""unavailable"" on the date in question, or have changed certain policies, procedures & most importantly, their pricing - if these facilities fail to inform RP of said changes, RP has to deal with the unhappy customers as a result.  Specifically, some of these facilities include:  The Beverly Hilton Hotel, the MDR Hotel among others.  Other facilities fail to note what is included in the price of the passes.  Namely spas/jacuzzies.  Personally, as much as I love the ability to use a particular hotels pool, it would be nice to know if said hotels have hot tubs etc.  Sadly, these places do not fully disclose to RP what is/is not offered at their locations and the customers must call the actual hotel to find out.  This leads to getting the run around by said hotels which subsequently breeds frustration for customers.  Is it so difficult for these hotels to list out whether or not a facility has a hot tub?  Especially if they have gone out of their way to describe in great detail all of the supposed amenities that come with the heft price tag of a day spent.  I guess I would only suggest that RP make it a priority to ensure that what the hotels claim to provide are actually provided so that when customers make inquiries, RP isn't forced to respond with a ""not sure about that.""  This type of bate & switch type of advertising seems to be more common these days than ever before, and is not only limited to day pass service providers.  It seems that this is becoming more wide spread among many 3rd party service providers who are not being provided with complete information, yet are forced to put up with angry customer complaints.",US,5,2,"{'neg': 0.089, 'neu': 0.845, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.9101}",-0.9101

A little inconvenienced,"We went on a Friday evening and had 3 day passes for water park only. Arrived before 4p to the downstairs lobby for the designated wristband pickup. No one was available to assist. We waited for a couple of minutes until man came that was already off the clock asked if we needed help. There was no sign stating they were open/closed or off to lunch.  He went to check with the front lobby which he then came back to say they were ‚Äúclosed for the day ‚Äú. To check with the water park and they ‚Äúshould‚Äù have passes there. This was a bit of an inconvenience for us because had this been our first time there, we wouldn‚Äôt have known what to do or how far the front desk was. Or if someone in our group was elderly or handicap. Since there are quite a few stairs to go up with no elevator, this can be a huge inconvenience for some families. We did arrive to paradise springs about 10-15 minutes later. They did indeed have wristbands once we arrived before getting checked at the gate. We showed our email and were provided our 3 wristbands. Loved the fact that there was hardly anyone there. We figured it was due to a lot of schools already back.

I asked again for clarification and someone else said ""typically it is a large padded seat large enough for two guests."" ""Typically"" didn't reassure me so I called the hotel directly and the woman I spoke with had to go outside and look at the daybed to see if it sat one or two people. She said two people will fit so we were good with that. I think the description could have been more clear - like Daybed x1, (accommodates two people).

I went to Chaminade in Santa Cruz,"I went to Chaminade in Santa Cruz. Iffy, at best. When I drove up, I thought: OMG! The actual resort looks so generic and boring. I live in Seabright -- right at the beach, about 10 minutes away -- and I should have stayed there...or gone to The Refuge in Carmel Valley, which I usually do. I couldn't take that much time -- driving wise -- so, I took a chance on Chaminade. Wrong. First, I thought, they have this ""amazing'' restaurant called The View, because of its incredible view (high up) of the water. The view is beautiful. The restaurant: save your money! I know it has been difficult, because of the pandemic, to find competent servers. Mine could not have been worse. I ordered something for lunch, waited about 30 minutes, and then was presented with half of my order, which was supposed to be scrambled eggs, country potatoes, and tofu instead of bacon or sausage. Instead, I received country potatoes and tofu. When I pointed this out, she said, ""Oops, so sorry, enjoy this!'' I said, of course, she would not be charging me full price, and she nodded. The bill reflected otherwise, so I asked to see the manager, who never came and finally -- about waiting about 15 minutes -- was told the lunch was for free. The pool experience was on par with that. It was a Tuesday in August, and at 1 p.m. it was crowded with families with a lot of kids...who, apparently, took precedence. There are two hot tubs, to complement the two pools. Both had kids in them, without parents (under the age of 10ish). I asked the one I wanted to go in -- which had three young girls -- if it was ""Okay'' to turn on the jets. They said no. I shan't ever get a Resort Pass again. And I had a friend who was thinking of having her wedding at Chaminade, and I said: DO NOT DO IT!!!!!!! They booked something, instead, in Carmel Valley:)Also, when someone gets a Resort Pass, how many children to they get to bring in with their Resort Pass or do they pay extra?

Vista Collina was lovely & I appreciate‚Ä¶,"Vista Collina was lovely & I appreciate the ease of finding beautiful options to hang poolside in a cabana surrounded by nature. Felt transported to the mediterranean.We booked a cabana to celebrate both mother's day & a birthday. Unfortunately, you can't bring in outside drinks or food, which is totally understandable if service to receive these options was available, however, the bar closed in the middle of the day! We had to find someone to help us when we realized there was no one there ( & were advised it was because it was a quiet pool day) we were the only group of 6 with a few other people enjoying pool area. Cabana booking was from 8am to 10 pm, so imagine the total bummer of not being able to enjoy drinks, order a coffee OR food, throughout the length of time we anticipated to enjoy a full pool day.  WHAT!! Had to find the hotel manager to find out how to feed & accommodate our groups food & beverage needs. Definitely not a compliment to the poolside wine country pamper party we were trying to have. Resort pass should advertise there is a chance you WONT have a server & the hotel chooses to close 3 hours into your rental. Disconnect between Resort pass & the hotel obviously. If this is the case & there is a chance of closing early, notify your guests, # 1 & # 2, don't limit outside food and bev as an option. I would have given more stars overall for the facility & lovely staff of Vista Collina but unfortunately, the lack of communication affects the overall review.

Since the cabana was in use, they apologized for their mistake and offered us a couch to sit at to enjoy since we were already there & to makeup for their mistake. So I thought. I never imagined, I would be charged for that couch in lieu of our cabana.  When expecting someone to pay for something, you must be clear. I agreed to  pay$495 for a cabana. When the hotel was unable to service that contract, they then need to present a new contract NOT assume I know I‚Äôm not being charged for something I would have never agreed to.My husband is sick.

I gave this hotel every opportunity to do the right thing and the manager wouldn‚Äôt even take my calls.

What a scam,"What a scam. If you buy directly from the ticket booth, its almost 50% cheaper! Guy at the front shook his head when he found out how much we paid using resortpass.

Be VERY careful booking a pool day pass‚Ä¶,"Be VERY careful booking a pool day pass through Resort Pass.  I booked a day pass for my wife and myself at the Hilton in Waikoloa.  Long story short, they advertised a day pass to be $50 with and additional $50 prepaid toward food and drinks.  That's not a bad deal at all.  However when I arrived a the Hilton Waikoloa nobody had any idea about the $50 in pre paid food and drink.  Hilton Customer service told me the day pass cost $100 and that they had no arrangement for prepaid food and drinks.  Obviously there's a bad disconnect between ResortPass and Hilton.  Additionally the Hilton C.S. reps and Manager were steadfast in their opinion that this was my problem and not theirs even though they acknowledged they had advised their I.T. department about this problem before.  I was told to feel lucky that I didnt also have to pay for parking on this particular day because they were servicing the parking meters and not charging for parking.

Tried to contact the hotel on Friday morning to no avail. RP charged our card that day. After not hearing from the hotel for 4 days, I decided to dispute the charge with AMEX and write a Yelp review about the hotel. The hotel rep promised to make it right and reverse the charge for us on Yelp. Fast forward 3 weeks later, my wife got a nasty email from Madeline S. Taylor, RP's account manager, threatening us to retract the dispute because the hotel was able to confirm that we were there or we did not cancel (both were obviously false at this point).

They gave everyone in the pool a complimentary glass of champagne. The menu offered so many selections for lunch and all were delicious.  The waiters were very pleasant and the service was excellent.

4 stars because of misleading photo,"4 stars because of misleading photo on ResortPass; but swift recovery and great customer service on the property. The photo of the ""daybed"" in the online description photo that we booked was actually picturing a ""cabana."" Turns out we wanted a ""cabana"" (which was the same price anyway) as it was covered/shaded, but we had no way of knowing we'd booked the wrong option (which didn't actually even have a photo on the site). The problem with this was that we are two very Irish skin-toned white girls and need shade cover, which the cabana provides (and the daybed does not--word to the wise). When we arrived and I showed our booking, the attendant basically said, ""Oooh, that's the wrong photo, but sorry, we're all booked!"" We were a bit alarmed, because we both burn in 5 minutes and the daybed wasn't going to work. Luckily though, they ended up having a no-show that day, and we were able to secure the shaded cabana we *thought* we'd booked. The pool was lovely; nice and warm, and located right next to Tiki's. The staff was unobtrusive, and the cabana was very comfy. All in all, a really great experience after a minor hiccup at first.

Hotel really had no clue about Resortpass,"Hotel really had no clue what ResortPass was or what i had booked (WorkPass and Spa pass), so arrival was confusing and frustrating and took a long time.  I was literally told ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt offer rooms for just the day so you must be incorrect and couldn‚Äôt have booked that‚Äù  It put quite a damper on the anniversary day surprise for my husband, because I had to argue with staff to have them figure out how to find the reservation and get the accommodations I was promised. I had to show them proof via the email confirm, which didn‚Äôt have all the details that the hotel said they needed.  Resortpass needs to do a better job partnering with at least this hotel to ensure staff understands the agreement. Finally, Resortpass said i get complementary self-parking with my Workpass. But when I got to the hotel they said they didn‚Äôt offer self-park and I had to valet for $10/hr.   I had to raise my voice and insist to a manager that I was not paying for parking that I was promised would be free. In the end the manager fixed the issue for me, but totally embarrassing to have to beg for this. My husband was embarrassed. Finally the hotel then double charged me and said they had no proof that I had prepaid with ResortPass. In the end, it took 3 phone calls to fix the issue.  Based on these issues I unfortunately would not recommend this service.  It was an embarrassing hassle and a pricey one at that ($250 for the daypass and $150 per massage).

I found ResortPass online and thought this was a cool service however I wished ResortPass gave more detailed information on how the Pass actually worked.  I had to call the Marriott Hotel directly asking them if I could arrive after a certain time.  It wasn't a terrible task but I wish the description on ResortPass had more clarity.  In addition, upon my arrival at the hotel itself - the ""Cabana"" amenities were nonexistent.

Catfished,"Perhaps this hotel is great for people that just want to stay on River Street area and go out, but this is not the place if you want to use the pool.

They were all dirty, the cushions had food and stains. There was food, wetness, and mold all over the ground, my mom didn't want to take her shoes off. We only stayed for about 5 minutes before we decided between there also being not enough loungers, none left, kids jumping and splashing all around and the restaurants not being open yet that it was ridiculous to throw $200 away on it. Even the $40 resort pass would have been ridiculous since there would have been nowhere to sit unless we had prob gotten there at 8am to stake out a spot. They actually didn't argue with us at all about leaving and didn't even offer to clean the cabana or do anything. I think they must get this alot and they really don't care about taking care of the people poolside since they just are focusing on getting people in and out of the rooms.

Not worth the money,"My family and I stayed at a VRBO for the week. Checkout was at 10am and our flight wasn‚Äôt until 5pm.

The price per person for a day pass at this particular resort was $45 for an adult and $40 for children. I have 4 kids so that‚Äôs $250! I should have just booked a room! I also decided to splurge and rent a cabana. The resort staff seemed to disregard the fact that random people were using other cabanas. I paid a lot of money to use it! Also, there was a group of guests sitting right next to the children‚Äôs pool who were smoking. I politely asked them to not smoke and they proceeded to taunt me and continued to smoke. I mentioned the issue to some staff, who said they would keep an eye on the situation. But the group proceeded to act in a disrespectful manner.

Adult Pool??,"Overall I had a nice day and will go back again, but was not happy about a couple of things.  I booked here over other options because there was an ADULT  pool. This ADULT pool has a section of it that allows kids therefore it is not an ADULT pool. The lifeguard at times also allowed kids to get into the ADULT section of the pool and did not say anything to them.  Only when a supervisor would come by did they make the kids get in their section.  When approaching the ADULT pool go to the far side if you do not want to listen to kids screaming in the ADULT pool. The other negative was that the bartender at the swim up bar was overwhelmed. She was by herself from 11 - 1 and it could take 20-30 minutes to get a drink.  It wasn't her fault.  She was hustling but just couldn't keep up with all the orders on her own. Now the good... it was a great pool with plenty of chairs and the cabanas looked great if you want to spurge on one.  In the pool they have several booth tables that are a lot of fun if you have a lot of people with you. I went on a Thursday and there were plenty of people there, but I always saw a few open chairs.

I'm referring specifically to when I would enter that I wanted locations in Scottsdale, but half the time it would list out the locations in Phoenix first, and other times is would start with Scottsdale locations.  Because of this I accidentally took the time and booked a pool in Phoenix before I realized what had happened.  2) It's inconvenient that a user can't book multiple dates at a time and must start over for each date.3) A nice to have would be a ""wait list function"" with an email to users who are interested in a fully booked location in the event that there is a cancellation take place an a spot opens up.",US,3,1,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.884, 'pos': 0.083, 'compound': 0.7814}",0.7814

"5 stars to Resort Pass, NOT the Hilton's. So close to a 5 star but could not!","Resort Pass was awesome and was valuable allowing local businesses to partner with larger resorts.  This was a win, win for guest (discount) and businesses (kickback) alike!  If it wasn't for the discount with Resort Pass, then I might not have ""found time"" to venture over to Hilton Waikola.  (Big Island, Hawaii)  I am only giving the 5 stars to Resort Pass, not the resort.  Why?  Yes, it is Hawaii but Hang Loose was taken to a whole new level at the resort.  I get it, your on vacation and you have worked really hard to look good in Hawaii (not to mention tan lines are weird)....but a thong in the children's pool area?  (Kinda creepy, like PeeWee Herman's Playhouse) So this is where Hilton Waikola could be helpful and refer the guest who prefer dental floss up their butt and only a small portion of their tata's covered over to the adults only pool.  (I get it...they probably have paid a lot of money for those implants and want to share their ""expense"" with others.  I was super young once upon a time)  Just sayin.....  Family friendly would have been nice for those traveling with little ones or just prefer a family friendly environment.  Other than that, the resort is GORGEOUS and provides fabulous amenities and on site resources!  (everything from car rentals to the spa)  The resorts beauty, layout, and amenities get 5 stars, unfortunately, the vibe near the children's kiddie cove, the big slide closes at 5, and lack of signs to let you know what path leads to where is the reason for 3.4 review for Hilton Waikola.",US,5,2,"{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.773, 'pos': 0.193, 'compound': 0.9947}",0.9947

Unfortunate disappointment,"We purchased two adult passes for October 1st. Our idea was to book 2 massages, take advantage of the Fitness area/pool, then get to the spa, take the massages, a shower and leave for diner nearby. Firstly, at the reception we had to wait about 10 minutes for them to figure how to actually activate the passes. Apparently the first person we talked with had no training in this area. Then the most unfortunate experience came when we got to the 4th floor, only to be advised that the Spa is closed for renovation until the 3rd and there is no shower/locker room access in the meantime. **at no point during the reservation we were provided with this information** So we kept our bags with us at the pool, stayed for a short while and left as we had to drive 60 minutes to take a shower at our place and get back to the city. We feel that we made a very poor investment and that there is plenty of reason to justify a refund. We made the concierge aware of this, but all we got was an apology.

I loved my experience with Resort Pass,"This was the best idea as a local Austinite, I decided to try out a Resort Pass at The Fairmont Austin Texas.

I was blown away by the professionalism and the 5 star treatment from the awesome staff,the customer service was superb, the food and drinks were amazing and being a professional local pool technician I was really impressed by the cleanliness of the pools, spas, saunas and steam room. The tiles at the pool are actually cleaned correctly and I was impressed being that‚Äôs my profession of 30 years so that‚Äôs saying a lot. I spent my day from noon till 7pm relaxing in the Spa lounges and the Pools. I had the tasty fish tacos and the sweet potato fries üòã I had a Great Mojito, and an Angry Gecko drink that was delicious.There was a slight issue at the end of the day involving a pool pump leaking in the women‚Äôs spa lounge, but these professionals handled this minor issue the best they could and went above and beyond to make me and others feel comfortable, They just let us take over the Men‚Äôs lounge (no men using it) and gave me and other women these awesome collagen gold eye masks and that lounge was awesome too.

"I think ResortPass is a great service, but...","I think ResortPass is a great service.  I didn't know it existed until yesterday. I love that you can go and use the pool and spa facilities at hotels all over the country. It's fantastic. I give the service 5 stars.  One note, the price fluctuates. When I first saw the Hyatt it was $25/person.  When I went to book 10 mins later it was $35/person.  Also, you never know what you're going to get when you actually get to the pool. There were 3 of us and when we got to the pool, it was full.  There were no available seats.  The pool was full of kids in giant inflatable rafts.  Even though we were told no outside food or drink, a family of 8 got off the elevator with bags of food and a cooler.  I understand that ResortPass has no control of that, but it's a reality that you could get to a pool and there is no room, and it won't be peaceful or quiet. That's why I rated this 3 stars - the service gets 5, but my experience yesterday gets 1 star.",US,3,1,"{'neg': 0.056, 'neu': 0.907, 'pos': 0.038, 'compound': -0.3802}",-0.3802
The worst service and experience at Atlantic Hotel & Spa,"If I could give a rating of zero stars, I would because this hotel does not even deserve one star.  Let‚Äôs begin with the fact that I was celebrating my birthday on August 10, 2019 when we went to The Atlantic Hotel & Spa.  My friends booked this place and bought the Spa Day pass.  I would like to say that we were greeted with a welcoming smile but instead the ladies in the front desk for the Spa looked at our group as if we were low class people, which was very insulting.  The look of disgust that we received was uncalled for and rude.  Not even a ‚ÄúHello, how can we assist you?‚Äù.   It was as if we were bothering them with our presence.   When we stated that it was our first time there one of the front desk ladies said ‚Äúoh, you made it to the front of the class‚Äù another insult.  I am not sure if this hotel trains their staff to treat the guests like this or what, but this is not the type of service we deserved.  We are hard working women and on top of the disrespect we received, we were still polite.  We were a party of seven and they only gave us one tiny locker for the seven of us and told us they did not have any more lockers for us.  No towels were provided and honestly this hotel does not even look like a 4-5-star hotel for these ladies that work in the spa to be treating us like we were beneath them.  When in facts, we all make more money then those two women put together, yet we have manners.  Now, it does not end there, we go to the pool and a guest slipped and fell face first, bleeding everywhere.  No one from the hotel came to assist this poor woman, not even the manager or bartenders.  The guests of the hotel where the ones giving the woman ice for her face and assuring that she was okay, in case she needed to be taken to the hospital.  It still does not end there, we decided to order lunch from the bar‚Ä¶ worse idea ever.  I ordered the Signature Turkey Club sandwich, as I went to take a bite out of my sandwich, I notice a RAW piece of chicken on my sandwich.  Not only was that disgusting but it is also unsanitary and could have made me extremely sick.  Everyone at the table was grossed out, I ended up just eating French fries because who would want to eat after that.  The drinks were awful for the price and contained more sour mix than alcohol.  If this is how this hotel treats guests that buy a Spa Pass, then maybe they should not participate in the Spa Month events because this was one of the worse experiences and to top it off on someone‚Äôs birthday.  I wish I would have asked for the names of the women that work in the Spa so I could name them here because what they did to our group was uncalled for and extremely unprofessional.",US,1,0,"{'neg': 0.121, 'neu': 0.801, 'pos': 0.078, 'compound': -0.9878}",-0.9878

Extremely limited (if any) availability‚Ä¶poor value.,"Extremely limited (if any) availability for desired properties despite searching literally every date on the calendar.

Considering that the spa area is very small, nothing inside spa area aside from a steam sauna and small outdoor seating deck with no view. Seems outlandish to purchase an **additional $60 day pass** to use the pool, in ADDITION to the $75 spa pass (located in the adult pool area). There was also some confusion upon checking into the main reception upon arrival. They had us down for purchasing a Day pass, when in fact we had purchased a Spa Pass. Fortunately, all of the customer service at the Carneros Resort was top notch and that wasn‚Äôt a problem. However, reception assumed that purchase of the Spa pass included access to the Adult pool, but upon check into to the Spa area the staff assumed purchase of the Spa Pass included access to the Family Pool only (which is located on the opposite side of the property from the Spa) Fortunately, everything worked out.

Amazing view made it worth it....,"The venue and view were wonderful. Don‚Äôt think that this is an ‚Äúadults only‚Äù pool, as there were several children there the entire time we were there. There were also broken large umbrellas laying on the ground that ‚Äúneeded to be fixed‚Äù so we had to bake in the sun until the sun finally went under the clouds. The pool bar is definitely worth a visit, as the sunset views are spectacular. Our group voted to go again, but early evening is the best bet.
